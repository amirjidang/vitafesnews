While the details of the settlement were kept private, reports suggest that the former couple had a prenuptial agreement in place that protected Jalen's assets.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only that, but the fact that the two were only married for three years suggests that no alimony would be due. Since the two shared no children, there's no child support to factor in, either.</p><p>But even if there wasn't a prenup, it doesn't sound like Jalen Rose has any hard feelings against his former wife.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In a recent interview with Complex</a>, Rose addressed rumors that his close friendship with fellow <a href=#>ESPN commentator Stephen A. Smith had caused marital issues</a> with Qerim.</p><p>Rose denied these rumors and said "In my personal relationship, it was laughable to me, to see [Molly Querim] and I mutually part ways, be in accord about why we’re parting ways, and still see people speculating on why,” he said, reflecting on the public response to the news and the speculation that followed.</p><p><strong><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans React To Rumors Adele Is Dating NBA Agent Rich Paul</a></span></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Not only speculating—in particular saying it was because her and Stephen A.

We still 100."</p><p>Jalen clarified, "I would just say that for people who thought we parted ways because they have a relationship? Then I got some swampland in Detroit to sell you for top dollar. That is not why we split."</p><h2 id=how-much-is-jale-rose-worth>How Much Is Jale Rose Worth?</h2><p>While the terms of the divorce settlement were kept confidential, it's worth examining how the former NBA star's financial standing has been impacted by the divorce.</p><p>Rose's net worth has been a subject of speculation over the years. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to CAknowledge</a>, his net worth as of 2023 is estimated to be around $60 million.
