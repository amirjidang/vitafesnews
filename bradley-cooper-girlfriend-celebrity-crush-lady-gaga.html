Of course, fans think the Hangover and A Star Is Born actor is just about the hottest star in Hollywood. But so do several celebrities. Bradley has certainly dated his fair share of famous women, namely his baby-mama model Irina Shayk who <a href=#>he's currently co-parenting his daughter with</a>. But Bradley's relationship history also includes actor Jennifer Esposito, model Suki Waterhouse, Star Trek star Zoe Saldana, Renee Zellwegger, and he's even had a brief fling with Cameron Diaz. So, yeah, Bradley has gotten around a little bit. But the man could easily find a new girlfriend in Hollywood if he chooses...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Those famous women aside, there are countless other beautiful, talented, and noteworthy celebrities <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who've openly flirted with Bradley</a>. Most of whom appear to be absolutely down to date him should he ever be looking. These are the famous people who seem to be lusting after the acclaimed actor, singer, and director...</p><h2 id=lady-gaga><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Lady Gaga</span></h2><p>The most obvious celebrity on this list is <a href=#>Lady Gaga</a>. So much has been made out of whatever did or didn't happen between the two co-stars. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In an interview with Oprah</a>, Lady Gaga said, "Quite frankly, I think the press is very silly. I mean, we made a love story. For me, as a performer and as an actress, of course, we wanted people to believe that we were in love." But, seriously, there's also no denying that she waxes poetic about him and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">love experts seem to think she was into him</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=selena-gomez><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Selena Gomez</span></h2><p>During an interview for her 2013 album, "Stars Dance", <a href=#>Selena Gomez</a> has asked about meeting Bradley Cooper. The interviewer claimed that he couldn't get any words out when he met him. Selena said she experienced the same thing when she came face-to-face with the handsome Hangover star. "I just remember seeing him and kind of freaking out and running away," Selena admitted," He was so beautiful."</p><h2 id=robin-quivers><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Robin Quivers</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Howard Stern's</a> longtime co-host Robin Quivers has freely admitted to many of her celebrity crushes. Not only that but she's flirted with them whenever they appear on the acclaimed SiriusXM radio show for an interview with The King Of All Media. Bradley Cooper is one of her favorites. On numerous occasions, she's told Howard about how handsome she finds Bradley. In an 'F, Marry, Kill' game, she claimed she wanted to 'F' Bradley.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jennifer Lawrence And Bradley Cooper + 9 Other Acting Duos Who've Starred Together Multiple Times</a></span></p><h2 id=amy-schumer><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Amy Schumer</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The now-married and new mother, Amy Schumer, admitted to her crush on Bradley when she was on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. She claimed that Bradley is the type of guy who stares directly into your eyes and asks you questions when you're talking to him. Amy also said that she feels uncomfortable talking to somebody that handsome yet loves to lustfully yell out his name whenever she sees him at events.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Taylor Swift</span></h2><p>According to Radar Online in 2013, Taylor Swift asked Jennifer Lawrence, a friend and frequent co-star of Bradley's, if she could introduce her to the star. While this report has not been legitimized by Taylor herself, enough information about Taylor lusting after Bradley exists. Still, this moment was a flash in the pan as Taylor swiftly moved on to crushing on (and dating) other major celebrities. For the record, the same source claims that Bradley had no interest in meeting Taylor and had to politely decline.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Irina Shayk Supports Ex Bradley Cooper By Attending The Premiere For His Film ‘Nightmare Alley’</a></span></p><h2 id=wendy-williams><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Wendy Williams</span></h2><p>Love her or hate her, daytime talk show host Wendy Williams is always open about her feelings and opinions.

In fact, she claims that Bradley is one of her biggest celebrity crushes.</p><h2 id=natalie-maines><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Natalie Maines</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During an interview on Ellen DeGeneres's talk show, acclaimed singer Natalie Maines of The Chicks (formerly The Dixie Chicks) got caught up in a game of "Who'd You Rather Date?" Natalie chose Bradley over both Brad Pitt, The Weeknd, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Leonardo DiCaprio. When Bradley was pitted up against Lenny Kravitz, Natalie admitted that she had grown up being in love with Lenny. In fact, she was convinced that she was going to marry him one day... Natalie still went with Bradley.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Bradley Cooper’s Relationship With His Daughter, Lea</a></span></p><h2 id=hannah-brown><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Hannah Brown</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ellen DeGeneres' "Who'd You Rather Date" game also exposed Hannah B's crush on Bradley Cooper.

This time it was former Real Housewives star, Bethenny Frankel. Bradley made it to the end of her list, but he also got kicked off by Jake Gyllenhall.

Still, Bradley won out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bang-chan><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Bang Chan</span></h2><p>K-Pop star Bang Chan has also admitted to having a thing for the Star Is Born actor.
