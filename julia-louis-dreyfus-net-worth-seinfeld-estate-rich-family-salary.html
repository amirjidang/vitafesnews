Still, she made a ton of money playing Elaine on Seinfeld. It's said that the cast made a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"base salary" of around $45 million</a>. That definitely makes up a large portion of the star's total net worth.</p><p>Celebrity Net Worth reported that in 1993, the cast asked for more money and began making $3.8 million a season or $150,000 for each episode. That number shot way up in May 1997 when they began making $600,000 for each episode of season 9 (or $15 million total).</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Julia Louis-Dreyfus Still Gets Emotional Remembering Her Last Day Backstage On Seinfeld">Julia Louis-Dreyfus Still Gets Emotional Remembering Her Last Day Backstage On Seinfeld</a></span></p><p>The cast eventually petitioned for—and won—$1 million per episode in the show's final season, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Distractify</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While fans would likely guess that <a href=#>Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Jason Alexander, Jerry Seinfeld, and Michael Richards make a ton of money</a> from royalties and reruns of the show, that's not the case.</p><p>Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David make a lot of money from Seinfeld royalties, and the other stars get some DVD sale profits and "residuals" that actors who are part of SAG-AFTRA get.</p><p>To date, Seinfeld has made an estimated $4 billion in royalties from syndication, but Julia Louis-Dreyfus hasn't seen any of that money. That might not be too terrible for the actress, though; she claims to not remember anything from her days on Seinfeld.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">During an appearance on David Letterman</a>, when asked if she missed her time as Elaine, Julia answered, "I do miss it," but she explained it was kind of weird that the show would be on syndication "forever."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"That's kind of odd because it's like you know your high school yearbook on television, you know...

After Seinfeld and other sitcom successes, it seemed she was nearly unstoppable.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Julia went on to appear in a handful of other projects</a> before signing on for a seven-year run on Veep.
