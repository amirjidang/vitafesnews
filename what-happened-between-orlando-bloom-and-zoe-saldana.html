For instance, <a href=#>Pirates of the Caribbean actor, Orlando Bloom</a> didn't enjoy kissing the <a href=#>From Scratch star, Zoe Saldana</a> in their 2006 film, Haven.Ironically, the two had electric chemistry onscreen. Here's what really happened behind the scenes.<span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Test Audience For The Big Bang Theory Hated A Main Character During The Original Pilot Screening</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=orlando-bloom-and-zoe-saldana-hated-kissing-each-other-on-haven>Orlando Bloom And Zoe Saldana Hated Kissing Each Other On 'Haven'</h2><p>In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2006 interview with People</a>, Bloom was asked: "Your costar <a href=#>Zoe Saldana</a> tells us that kissing you was 'gross.' How could she?" to which he responded, "I hated kissing Zoe too!" For the record, he wasn't actually repulsed by <a href=#>the Avatar star</a>.</p><p>"I was like, 'Take your tongue out of my mouth, please. Your boyfriend is standing right there,'" he explained. "Most people think kissing beautiful costars must be great. But it's always awkward, man."</p><p>Meanwhile, Saldana raved about Bloom's professionalism during those sequences. "The same way it is to do intimate scenes in a movie period. You can only pray to have a professional, attractive, good-smelling partner," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she told blackfilm.com</a> when asked how it was filming such scenes with Bloom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I've been very lucky with that. Then it is beautiful when you're protected and the person you're working with has your back and is so professional and respectful. Then is does not make it seem like a job."</p><p>She continued: "All in all, for me, shooting intimate scenes is a bit uncomfortable; the technicality demands a lot of concentration and lots of work."</p><p>"You're sweating, all these lights are all up in your face you're wearing very few clothes, and everybody's there--the cinematographer, the director and all the crew and he asking you to kiss him in some odd angle-- 'it's a better angle for the lighting'--and it's all a bit uncomfortable. But as long as looks like it then that's what we were there to do. But I am producing so that's really good for me."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Zoe Saldana and Bradley Cooper Enjoyed Kissing Each Other During This Film</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-orlando-bloom-and-zoe-saldana-really-feels-about-working-together-on-haven>How Orlando Bloom And Zoe Saldana Really Feels About Working Together On 'Haven'</h2><p>When asked about her offscreen relationship with Bloom, Saldana said that the actor helped her "warm up" to the set and crew.</p><p>"Orlando helped me to warm up to the script and to the crew quicker; we had done a film together earlier that year so I was familiar with him we knew each other so it was fantastic to work with him again," she shared to blackfilm.com. She also said that she "trusted" her co-star throughout the film.</p><p>As for Bloom, who co-produced the film, he described the whole cast and crew of Haven as "family," including Saldana. "The energy, the enthusiasm, the gusto and the passion -- I mean, it was a family," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he told MTV</a> at that time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We were all picking up lights and carrying them and running them from one place to another. It's like, 'OK, forget the lights. The sun's coming down, we'll use this.' And that energy and excitement was coming from every member of the cast and crew."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Joshua Bassett Admits He's Been Turning Down Projects And Agents Hate It</a></span></p><h2 id=are-orlando-bloom-and-zoe-saldana-friends-in-real-life>Are Orlando Bloom And Zoe Saldana Friends In Real Life?</h2><p>Before Haven, A 23-year-old <a href=#>Saldana "regretfully" acted alongside Bloom on Pirates of the Caribbean</a>.</p><p>"It was my first exposure to a major Hollywood mega movie, where there were just so many actors and so many producers and so many crew members," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she told EW</a>. "We were shooting in different locations, and the environments were not that agreeable, sometimes, to our shoot days."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She continued: "I was very young, and it was just a little too big for me, and the pace of it was a little too fast. I walked away not really having a good experience from it overall. I felt like I was lost in the trenches of it a great deal, and I just didn't feel like that was okay."</p><p>After that, she and Bloom formed a professional friendship that made filming Haven a fun time for them. They even presented an award together at the 2014 Golden Globes. "And the Golden globe for the 2 most beautiful presenters ever goes to Zoe Saldana and Orlando Bloom," a fan tweeted at that time.
