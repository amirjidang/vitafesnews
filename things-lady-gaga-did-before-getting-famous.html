She showed interest in music at a very early age and by the time she was five, she had already learned how to play the piano.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">On Its 10th Anniversary, Fans Share How Lady Gaga’s ‘Born This Way’ Changed Their Lives</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"When Stefani started to crawl, she would use the leg of the piano to pull herself up and stand, and in doing so, her fingers would eventually land on the keys," said Cynthia Germanotta, Lady Gaga's&nbsp;mom, for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billboard</a>. "She would stay there and just keep pressing the keys to hear the sound. We would then start to hold her up or sit on the bench and let her tinker."</p><h2 id=attended-a-private-all-girls-school><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Attended A Private All-Girls School</span></h2><p>Lady Gaga attended a private all-girls Catholic school Convent of the Sacred Heart, located in Manhattan. And she wasn't the only future celeb there — Nicky Hilton went to the same school as well. Gaga talked about&nbsp;this back in 2008 during an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a> with&nbsp;DJ Ron Slomowicz. "I never saw Paris, she was older than me, and it’s funny that the press always write that I went to school with the Hilton sisters, but I actually only went with Nicky," said the "Poker Face" singer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gaga-even-got-admitted-to-new-york-university-tisch-school-of-the-arts><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Gaga&nbsp;Even Got Admitted To New York University Tisch School of the Arts</span></h2><p>Lady Gaga's artistic potential was recognized by one of the best drama schools in the world, New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, where she was enrolled before dropping out to pursue a music career. During a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">radio interview</a> with Ryan Seacrest, Gaga revealed that one of her songs was written in the school's library.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Before Her Fame, Social Media Trolls Said Lady Gaga Would Never Make It</a></span></p><p>"Yes I did go to college Ryan — I went to NYU Tisch.

Because she was still underage, Gaga had to bring her mother with her to the New York bars where she'd perform. "She’d say to the manager, 'Listen, I know she’s too young to be in here, and I’m too old to be in here, but she’s incredibly talented and she’s a singer-songwriter and can she sign up on your open-mic list?' And we just sat and waited around for them to call my name,”&nbsp;revealed Gaga in a 2009 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with The Times UK</a>.</p><h2 id=she-studied-method-acting-for-ten-years><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>She Studied Method Acting For Ten Years</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you've seen Gaga in American Horror Story: Hotel or A Star Is Born, then you already know that she's an amazing actress.&nbsp;That is because Gaga studied acting for ten years. "I studied method acting for almost ten years. I studied [Lee] Strasberg, the version that makes people roll their eyes," said Gaga in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2015 interview</a> for News.com.au.</p><h2 id=in-2001-gaga-appeared-in-an-episode-of-the-sopranos><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>In 2001, Gaga Appeared In An Episode of 'The Sopranos'</span></h2><p>Long before she starred in the Oscar-nominated movie A Star Is Born, Stefani Germanotta appeared in a very popular series — HBO's The Sopranos. Her role in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"The Telltale Moozadell"</a> episode of the series was pretty small, though — she played 'Girl at Swimming Pool #2',</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-got-signed-to-a-record-label-in-2006><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>She Got Signed To A Record Label In&nbsp;2006</span></h2><p>After years of trying to make it in the music industry, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lady Gaga</a> finally got signed to a record label in 2006. The label in question was the Island Def Jam Records, whose CEO was rapper L.A. Reid. Only two months after signing her, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">L.A. Reid decided to drop Gaga</a> from his label, and boy did he make a wrong decision there because&nbsp;Gaga's career finally took off and she skyrocketed to international fame soon after.</p><h2 id=she-released-an-ep-the-same-year><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>She Released An EP The Same Year</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before she created her Lady Gaga persona and released her debut studio album The Fame, Gaga had recorded an EP named Red and Blue, under her real name, Stefani.&nbsp;The album, which was released in 2006, had only five tracks and was&nbsp;only 20 minutes long.&nbsp;It was sold at the Bitter End, a New York nightclub where Gaga used to perform.</p><h2 id=gaga-has-written-many-songs-for-other-famous-musicians><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Gaga Has Written Many Songs For Other&nbsp;Famous Musicians</span></h2><p>Apart from having an amazing voice that can sing almost any note you want, Lady Gaga is also a very skilled songwriter. Not only did she write all of her biggest hits such as "Poker Face" and "Bad Romance", but Gaga has also written for other famous stars.&nbsp;Britney Spears' song "Quicksand" and Jennifer Lopez's "Hypnotico" are just some of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">songs Lady Gaga wrote</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-was-an-opening-act-for-a-girl-group><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>She Was An Opening Act For&nbsp;A Girl Group</span></h2><p>Before she got to headline her own concerts in arenas and stadiums all over the world, Lady Gaga&nbsp;was&nbsp;an opening act for the Pussycat Dolls on their Doll Domination Tour&nbsp;in Europe and Oceania back in 2008.&nbsp;Gaga did such a good job that some critics said she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stole the show</a> and outshined the headliners.&nbsp;Getting to work with an iconic group like the Pussycat Dolls definitely helped Gaga's&nbsp;career.</p><p><span class="related-single next-single">Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's How The Most Successful 'Real Housewives' Made All Their Money</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroaGenMBuuMCdsGafkZyubrDInWSbnZakv6Z5xp6rraGenHqnrcyorKxn</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./15-most-dangerous-celebrity-stalkers-in-history.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Most Dangerous Celebrity Stalkers In History">&larr;
