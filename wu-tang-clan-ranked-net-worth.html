RZA, GZA, Ol' Dirty Bastard, Method Man, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, Inspectah Deck, U-God, and Masta Killa are all iconic names.</p><p>Although all have arguably contributed to the progression of hip-hop, some have ended up with higher net worths than others. The band’s sound transcends generations. While they rose to fame in the 90s, there are those who were born in the 2000s that know and love their work. “Wu-tang is for the children,” as the saying goes.</p><p>Here is the net worth, in order from lowest to highest, of the original residents of the 36 Chambers.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why The Wu Tang Clan Members Really Couldn't Get Along</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ol-39-dirty-bastard---500-000><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Ol' Dirty Bastard - $500,000</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ol-dirty-bastard.jpg><p>Outside of The Wu-Tang Clan, Ol' Dirty Bastard hit the Billboard top 40s with songs like "Got Your Money." However, he suffered numerous financial setbacks due to drug addiction and legal fees. After all, ODB was almost as famous for his frequent brushes with the law as he was for his raunchy lyrics.</p><p>It is worth noting that, while ODB is estimated to be worth around $500k, there are some who believe he's worth more than that - especially posthumously. in 2022, his widow, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Icelene Jones sued Wu-Tang productions for making irregular payments</a>, and for not sharing accounting records with her. That same year, his former manager, Jarred Weisfeld told The New York Post, "There is no doubt in my mind that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the estate has generated seven figures since his death</a> ... That would have come through song royalties, documentaries, the use of his song in the opening credits of Knocked Up. For that alone, he should have gotten six figures."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That might be so - however, until public records say otherwise, ODB is firmly ensconced in ninth place.</p><h2 id=masta-killa---1-million><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Masta Killa - $1 million</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/masta-killa.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Masta released his first solo album, No Said Date, in 2004</a> - the same year that Ol' Dirty Bastard died. His most recent album, Loyalty Is Royalty, was released in 2017. Masta Killa is often credited for influencing the band to adopt most of its use of Chinese and Kung Fu imagery. His name is derived from a classic Kung Fu film Shaolin Master Killer. He is also related by blood to late R&B singer Marvin Gaye and Nat Turner, the leader of one of the most famous slave rebellions in U.S. history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth's estimations, these days, the rapper is worth $1 million.</p><h2 id=inspectah-deck---4-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Inspectah Deck - $4 million</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/inspectah-deck.jpg><p>Working as both a rapper and producer, Celebrity Net Worth reports that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Inspectah Deck has accumulated approximately $4 million to his name</a>. His first solo studio album, UncontrolledSubstance came out in 1999, and since then, he's gone on to release four more. He makes guest appearances on other Wu-Tang members' solo albums, like those of Method Man and GZA, and also has collaborated with rappers like Big Pun and Mos Def (now known as Yasin Bay).</p><h2 id=u-god---5-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>U-God - $5 million</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/u-god.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>U-God has released 5 solo albums and one collaboration album since 1999 in addition to recording on every Wu-Tang album. His first album, Golden Arms Redemption landed at number 15 on the U.S. R&B charts and 58th in the Billboard top 200. His autobiography, Raw: My Journey Into The Wu-Tang Clan, was released in 2018.</p><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">U-God is worth $5 million</a>.</p><h2 id=raekwon---6-million><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Raekwon - $6 million</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/raekwon.jpg><p>Raekwon signed on to the group in 1992. One year after joining the band, they released Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) which turned the band into the sensation that they are known as today. In 1994 he released his first solo track, Heaven and Hell, and later that year his first solo LP Only Built 4 Cuban Linx, would land at number 4 on the Billboard charts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Raekwon has released 7 studio albums with an 8th initially slated for release some time in 2022. However, at the time of writing, fans are still waiting.</p><h2 id=method-man---14-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Method Man - $14 million</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/method-man.jpg><p>Thanks to his frequent collaborations with <a href=#>Redman</a>, who some might be surprised to learn is not a member of the Wu-Tang Clan, as well as other solo ventures, Method Man now sits on a net worth of $14 million. His first solo album Tical was released in 1994 and he has since released 10 albums, 4 of them collaborations with Redman. In addition to music Method Man is an actor and had roles in films like Garden State, The Wackness, and How High which he co-starred in with Redman. He also owns a cannabis company in California, Tical, which is named for his first album.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Tamika Smith Went From Being Method Man's Assistant To His Wife</a></span></p><h2 id=ghostface-killah---10-million><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Ghostface Killah - $10 million</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ghostface-killah.jpg><p>His debut album IronMan came out in 1996. He joined the group when he was roommates with the band's founder, RZA, in the late 80s. Before his solo debut, Ghostface was one of the more prominent guest rappers on fellow Wu-Tang member Raekwon’s debut Only Built 4 Cuban Linx. In 2006 MTV gave him an honorable mention as one of the greatest MCs of all time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One reason Ghostface has close to the highest net worth in the band is that he is arguably the most prolific solo recording artist of the group. Ghostface has 13 solo studio albums and at least 5 collaboration albums, not including his recordings with the Wu-Tang Clan. Like Method Man, he is also an actor, though he usually just makes cameos as himself. He can be seen in television shows like The Boondocks and 30Rock and he made appearances in films like WalkHard and IronMan.</p><h2 id=gza---20-million><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>GZA - $20 million</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/gza.jpg><p>Coming in at second place is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GZA, with a net worth of approximately $20 million</a> - a figure thanks in part to solo projects like the album Liquid Swords, which critics often rank as one of the best hip hop albums of all time. With <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the most extensive English vocabularies in the game</a>, the rapper has also been involved in a number of films, with appearances in Smokin Aces, and Coffee and Cigarettes which he appeared in with RZA and comedian Bill Murray.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rza---30-million><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>RZA - $30 Million</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/rza.jpg><p>Finally, in the top spot is RZA, with a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth estimated to be at a whopping $30 million</a>. That only seems fair, though. After all, he is the founder and de facto leader of The Wu-Tang Clan.</p><p>Outside of Wu-Tang, RZA has also released a number of solo projects. Like his cousin, GZA, however, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he's also gone on to work in film, starring in and directing The Man With The Iron Fists</a>. On top of that, he also provided the musical score for the films Kill Bill Volume 1 and Volume 2.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiurmWklruoecKlmKdlopa7rLHDZqWerF2svLPAx2g%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./tori-eppard-death-playful-learners-preschool-member-passed-away-691020-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tori Eppard Death | Playful Learners Preschool Member Passed Away ">&larr;
