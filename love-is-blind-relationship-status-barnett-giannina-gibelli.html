The first season of the hit series premiered just before Valentine's Day in 2020, and the second season of Love is Blind is set to air on February 11, 2022. This reality show gathered a large group of girls and a large group of guys that essentially went on a blind date… but it was truly blind thanks to the pods that allowed for conversations but no visuals outside its walls.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's What LC Has Been Up To Since 'Love Is Blind'</a></span></p><p>To leave the pods and see the opposite sex, you had to choose one to marry and propose. If the other half agreed, they would be brought together and see each other for the first time. From there, the show followed the couples through adjusting to this new life by meeting family, navigating living together, and all the outside influences to deal with.</p><p>At the end of the show, the couple would state if they wanted to stay together or split. After the Altar was an episode that came out two years after the filming of season 1, giving us an update on the stars. As of 2022, here is the current status of the Love is Blind season one reality stars.</p><h2 id=lovebirds-lauren-amp-cameron-are-still-happily-married><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Lovebirds Lauren & Cameron Are Still Happily Married</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lauren Speed and Cameron Hamilton were among the first of the Love is Blind couples to get engaged. A fan favorite, these two were the least problematic and continue to generate support on social media. The couple has continued to share their love and adoration for each other on Instagram and seem to remain as in love as they were on the show.</p><h2 id=giannina-gibelli-is-living-her-best-life-and-dating><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Giannina Gibelli Is Living Her Best Life And Dating</span></h2><p>Giannina Milady Gibelli is a firecracker who regularly made headlines when the show first came out. Flipping the script on gender-norms, she got down on her knees to propose to Damian Powers through the wall, then ended up getting dumped on the altar. According to all her socials, Giannina is still single, but isn’t letting that stop her from enjoying her life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, many fans have been speculating since before Christmas 2021 that <a href=#>Giannina could potentially be in a relationship with Bachelor Nations Blake Horstmann</a>, as she has visited his hometown in Colorado numerous times. No official relationship announcement or statement have been shared by either party, though.</p><h2 id=damian-powers-is-single-and-struggles-with-loss-of-popularity><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Damian Powers Is Single And Struggles With Loss Of Popularity</span></h2><p>Damian Powers, Giannina’s ex-fiancé, drummed up lots of attention thanks to Love is Blind: After the Altar (Two Years Later). This episode revealed that he and Giannina had been working things out in a dating relationship, but he royally screwed it up by inviting his attractive girl friend, Francesca Farago, to the party. This move made him very unpopular with the audience, and many people are pointing that out on his Instagram posts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>15 Questions We Wish We Could Ask The Couples Of Netflix's Love Is Blind</a></span></p><h2 id=diamond-jack-is-currently-single-but-open-to-meeting-someone><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Diamond Jack Is Currently Single, But Open To Meeting Someone</span></h2><p>Love is Blind star Diamond Jack went through a whirlwind of relationships. On the show, she and Carlton Morton got close before he dropped the bomb that he is bisexual. Emotions erupted between the two, causing a major rift. Prior to After the Altar, her friend helped set her up with a man named Rumeal. The two seemed to hit it off, but Diamond is currently still single.</p><h2 id=amber-amp-barnett-s-marriage-is-thriving><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Amber & Barnett's Marriage Is Thriving</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Amber Pike and Matt Barnett are the only other couple who remains together from the show. <a href=#>Their relationship received mixed feelings</a> from both audiences and those around them, but they have shown that their love for each other is all that matters. They are still married and continue sharing their life together with fans on social media.</p><h2 id=jessica-batten-is-engaged-to-a-doctor-named-ben><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Jessica Batten Is Engaged To A Doctor Named Ben</span></h2><p>Jessica Batten <a href=#>started out the show as one of the most unpopular stars</a>, seeming to be self-centered, judgmental, and always trying to get her way. Once After the Alter premiered, the audience was shown her side of the story, and she garnered a lot more support. After a rollercoaster of feelings about Matt Barnett and Mark Cuevas, she is currently happily engaged to a doctor/surgeon named Ben.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Does Jessica Batten Regret Starring On 'Love Is Blind'?</a></span></p><h2 id=mark-cuevas-is-now-an-engaged-father-with-another-baby-on-the-way><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Mark Cuevas Is Now An Engaged Father With Another Baby On The Way</span></h2><p>Mark Anthony Cuevas proposed to Jessica Batten on the show and wanted to get married at the altar. After Jessica declined to seal their vows, Mark brokenheartedly searched for someone else to love. <a href=#>He was the talk of the town on the follow-up episode</a> of this reality show with rumors circulating he got someone pregnant. He is now engaged to his baby-mama with a second child on the way.</p><h2 id=kelly-chase-is-single-amp-pursuing-her-passions><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Kelly Chase Is Single & Pursuing Her Passions</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although Kelly Chase and Kenny Barnes were engaged, they ended up not getting married by the end of Love is Blind. Kelly has been working on herself since the finale, using her voice and platform to speak out to fellow survivors through her podcast and as an entrepreneur. She doesn’t share much personal detail online, but she is currently single and striving to tick off her bucket list.</p><h2 id=kenny-barnes-is-engaged-with-the-wedding-quickly-approaching><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Kenny Barnes Is Engaged With The Wedding Quickly Approaching</span></h2><p>Kenny Barnes may not have been ready to marry Kelly Chase during the filming of Love is Blind, but he found his significant other and settled down shortly afterwards.
