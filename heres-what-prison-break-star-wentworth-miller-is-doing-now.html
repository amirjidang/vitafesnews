In an ideal world, everyone actor who breaks through would find it relatively easy to capitalize on that momentum. In reality, however, there is a long history of actors that found the role of a lifetime only to have their careers hit the skids since they could <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">never find similar success</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the case of Wentworth Miller, he rose to fame entirely due to his starring role in the extremely popular show Prison Break. Unfortunately for Miller, after Prison Break was canceled the first time, he proved to be the perfect example of an actor who faded away after finding initial success.</p><p>Even though Wentworth Miller hasn’t headlined a major project recently if you think that he is sitting at home resting on his laurels that simply isn’t the case. In fact, when you compare the things that Miller has done over the last several years, on a professional level he is still more accomplished than most of his peers.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Stars Who Don't Realize They Aren't Famous Anymore</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=huge-potential>Huge Potential</h2><p>For an actor to truly become a star, there are two main things they need to accomplish. First, they need to get the powers that be in Hollywood to believe that the masses will pay to see them perform. After accomplishing that difficult feat, they have to put their money with their mouth is by starring in films or TV shows that actually connect with audiences. For proof of that fact, look no further than the fact that people regularly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rank the most attractive actors</a> or that “ugly” characters are regularly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">played by gorgeous actors</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately for actors, there is no way to truly know for sure if they will find success. However, if you sit back and look at the most successful actors in the world, there is one thing that the vast majority of them have in common, they are physically beautiful. When it comes to Wentworth Miller, he definitely stacks up in that department. After all, Miller was blessed with incredibly good looks and his eyes are so piercing that anyone who sees him on the big or little screen is bound to take note of him immediately.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">25 Ugly Show Characters Who Are Hot In Real Life</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-role-of-a-lifetime>The Role Of A Lifetime</h2><p>During the early years of Wentworth Miller’s career, he managed to land roles in several projects even though he was an unknown at that time. For example, before most people had any idea who Miller was, he showed up in films like Underworld, and many TV shows including ER, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Popular among others.</p><p>Based on the early success Wentworth Miller enjoyed, it was pretty obvious that if he wanted to be a star, all he needed to do was land a role in a project that would put him over the top. Fortunately, it didn’t take Miller too long to find the role he needed as he began starring in Prison Break in 2005.</p><p>Easily one of the most talked-about TV shows in 2005, Prison Break’s first season was so thrilling that many people still rave about it years later. As a matter of fact, even though Prison Break’s subsequent seasons largely disappointed, the show’s first season still meant so much to people that the show was revived years after it was initially canceled.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ranked: 15 Shows That Need A Reboot, Revival Or Reunion</a></span></p><h2 id=a-new-phase-in-life>A New Phase In Life</h2><p>When Prison Break came to an end the first time in 2009, most people assumed that Wentworth Miller was bound for bigger and better things. Surprisingly, however, his career never took off the way that his legions of fans expected it to. For that reason, many people may think that his acting days are currently long behind him.</p><p>If you take a look at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wentworth Miller’s IMDb page</a>, it quickly becomes clear that he still works regularly these days. For example, over the last several years, Miller appeared in 14 episodes of The Flash, 23 episodes of DC’s Legends of Tomorrow, and he made a one-time Batwoman cameo. In addition to Miller’s DC exploits, in 2019 he also had a recurring role in TV’s Madam Secretary and his other recent credits include Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aside from Wentworth Miller’s acting career, in recent years he has spent a lot of time tackling much more serious issues that are close to his hearts. For example, since Miller came out of the closet in 2007, he has spoken out against those who would diminish the rights of the LGBTQ+ community. Additionally, when photos of Miller that showed he’d gained weight went viral online, he took the opportunity to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">speak out about depression and body shaming</a>. While there is no way to know where Wentworth Miller’s career will take him in the future, it does seem clear that he will remain true to himself and support the downtrodden.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Is Prison Break Season 6 Finally Happening?
