However, it did generate significant media attention and intrigue.</p><p>Undeterred by the setbacks, Shyne signed a multi-million-dollar contract with Def Jam records. Despite the high expectations, his subsequent albums struggled to make a significant impact in the music industry.</p><p>Notably, Shyne’s self-titled album, released in 2000, garnered attention and peaked at No. 5 on the Billboard album chart.
