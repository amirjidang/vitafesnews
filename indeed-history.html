With a shared vision, Forster and Kahan recognized the need for a job search platform that specifically catered to finance professionals. Their entrepreneurial journey began in 1998 when they launched their first venture, Jobsinthemoney.com.</p><p>This initial endeavor proved successful, and after the sale of their first company, Forster and Kahan set out to revolutionize the job search industry. It was their ambition to create the world’s first search engine for jobs, providing job seekers with a comprehensive and user-friendly platform. Thus, Indeed.com was born, marking the beginning of their remarkable story.</p><p>Driven by their passion for helping people find meaningful employment, Forster and Kahan paved the way for a new era in job search technology. Their innovative approach and dedication to their mission have propelled Indeed to become a global leader in the industry.</p><p>“We wanted to create a platform that would empower job seekers and simplify the job search process. Our goal was to connect talented individuals with the right opportunities, helping them thrive in their careers.” – Paul Forster</p><p>Today, Indeed stands as a testament to the vision and determination of its founders.

This model has allowed Indeed to generate revenue and become one of the most profitable job search platforms in the world.</p><p>Companies can choose to sponsor their job listings on Indeed, giving them greater exposure to job seekers. When job seekers use Indeed’s search engine to find relevant positions, sponsored job listings appear at the top of the search results, increasing their visibility and attracting more applicants. Employers only pay when job seekers click on their sponsored listings, ensuring that their investment is cost-effective and based on actual engagement with their job postings.</p><p>Indeed’s pay-per-click model benefits both employers and job seekers. Employers can effectively target their desired audience and receive more qualified applications, while job seekers have access to a wide range of job opportunities from reputable companies.</p><p>“Indeed’s pay-per-click model allows companies to reach a larger pool of potential candidates, making the recruitment process more efficient and effective.”</p><p>– John Smith, HR Manager at ABC Corporation</p><p>By offering companies the opportunity to increase the visibility of their job listings, Indeed has become the go-to platform for employers seeking qualified candidates.
