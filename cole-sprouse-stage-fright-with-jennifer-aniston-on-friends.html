David Schwimmer himself admitted that going out was an impossible task. The show was on everywhere, and that still holds true today, as the next generation of TV watchers continues to enjoy the series. <span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Helen Baxendale Did Not Expect To Be On Friends And She Struggled Because Of It</a></span><strong><a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a></strong> was a major reason for the show's success, and she became a crush for millions around the world during the show. Not only was that true for the fans, but it also held true for the cast as well. We'll take a look back on the stars of the show that crushed on Jen, along with taking a look at which guest-star just couldn't keep it together during his scene with Aniston.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-lot-of-the-cast-crushed-on-jennifer-aniston-during-friends>A Lot Of The Cast Crushed On Jennifer Aniston During Friends</h2><p>Crushing on Jennifer Aniston was completely the norm during the '90s and her rise thanks to Friends. Heck, the argument can be made that this still holds true today...</p><p>Among the cast, Matt LeBlanc revealed that he did in fact crush on Jen, though he was from the only one. "Now I had a little crush on Jen in the very beginning, but I think the whole world did too, so what are you going to do," LeBlanc stated.</p><p>During the Friends reunion, David Schwimmer and Jennifer Aniston would also disclose some information, revealing that they also both crushed on one another, though the timing was never right. “I had a major crush on Jen. At some point we were both crushing hard on each other. But it was like two ships passing. One of us was always in a relationship and we never crossed that boundary. We respected that," David Schwimmer stated.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Did Jennifer Aniston and Tate Donovan's 90s Engagement End Because Of His Jealousy?</a></span></p><p>Perhaps the toughest crush of them all was between Aniston and Tate Donovan, who actually dated and engaged. What made matters that much harder for Donovan was the fact that <a href=#>the two were breaking up at the time of their shoot together on the sitcom.</a></p><p>“The only bummer was Jennifer and I were breaking up at the time…And so that was tricky to sort of act, and act like we are just meeting each other, and falling in love, or whatever, interested in each other, when we’re sort of breaking up. That was just tough.”</p><p>Turns out, another very young actor couldn't contain his crush on Aniston during a particular scene.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cole-sprouse-completely-blanked-out-while-sitting-on-the-couch-with-jennifer-aniston>Cole Sprouse Completely Blanked Out While Sitting On The Couch With Jennifer Aniston</h2><p>That's right, none other than Cole Sprouse completely blanked during a scene alongside Jennifer Aniston.

But I do remember being quite intimidated around her, because of that."</p><p>"I remember blanking on my lines, and having a kind of stage fright when she sat next to me on the couch in one episode. And I remember there was a camera man who was like, ‘Little boy's got a crush,’ or I forget what they said. Of course, I turned bright red. But I do remember feeling like I fell in love.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Friends Took Heat And Was Viewed As Desperate Following Winona Ryder's Controversial Cameo</a></span></p><p>Despite the hiccup on-set, the actor had a blast with the role.</p><h2 id=cole-sprouse-had-a-blast-working-with-the-friends-cast>Cole Sprouse Had A Blast Working With The Friends Cast</h2><p>Sprouse does recall feeling intimidated entering such a sitcom, especially given how established the show already was at the time of his arrival.</p><p>Despite the early nervousness, all the feelings faded away given how easy-going the cast was.
