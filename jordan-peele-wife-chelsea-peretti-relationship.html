As a result, some <a href=#>Hollywood power couples have accumulated so much money</a> that their collective net worth is mindblowing.With that in mind, it can sometimes seem like Hollywood power couples have everything going for them. In reality, however, there are several aspects of being part of a famous couple that can result in problems for everyone involved.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These Celebrity Couples Have Been Together For 15+ Years</a></span>For famous Hollywood couples, one of the most obvious problems is how much they get judged. If they don't seem to share any affection in public then their relationship must be fizzling out but <a href=#>if they exhibit PDA too much then observers complain they need to tone it down</a>.On top of more obvious issues like that, Hollywood couples have to deal with other headaches most people don't think about. As it turns out, something Chelsea Peretti once said during an interview perfectly underlined one of those rarely thought-of issues famous couples cope with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-is-jordan-peele-married-to>Who Is Jordan Peele Married To?</h2><p>Thanks to the success that Chelsea Peretti And Jordan Peele have both enjoyed during their careers, both have millions of fans who would love to spend time with them. However, the two stars seem to be each other's biggest fans as they have reportedly loved being together for years now.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything We Know About Chelsea Peretti And Jordan Peele's Relationship</a></span></p><p>In this day and age, a lot of celebrity couples seem to document every moment they are together on social media. On the other hand, Jordan Peele and Chelsea Peretti have mostly kept their relationship private.</p><p>For proof of how much Jordan Peele and Chelsea Peretti like to keep their relationship to themselves, all you have to do is keep in mind the couple eloped. Since both performers are highly successful, they certainly could have afforded to throw a ceremony and reception.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Chelsea Peretti and Jordan Peele tied the knot in 2016, they welcomed their son Beaumont into the world in 2017. From all accounts, the family has been happy together ever since.</p><h2 id=chelsea-peretti-s-quote-about-her-husband-revealed-a-sad-truth>Chelsea Peretti's Quote About Her Husband Revealed A Sad Truth</h2><p>Over the years, there have been a few Hollywood couples who truly seemed to be on equal footing in the business. A perfect example of that was Demi Moore and Bruce Willis back when they were married.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Things You Might Not Know About Chelsea Peretti's Life And Career</a></span></p><p>In the vast majority of cases, however, one member of a Hollywood power couple wields more influence and power in the entertainment industry. Unfortunately, it almost always is the man in the couple who has more authority in the movie business.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2014, Jordan Peele and his longtime friend and collaborator Keegan-Michael Key took over Entertainment Weekly for an issue. Around the same time, Chelsea Peretti and Ike Barinholtz were interviewed for the same magazine.</p><p>During Chelsea Peretti and Ike Barinholtz's interview, both of them were asked to explain when they met Key and Peele. After Peretti explained that she met Peele after he reached out on social media to praise a project she had worked on, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she asked a telling question</a>.</p><p>"Am I supposed to talk about the fact that we live together? [Laughs] Or should I pretend heâ€™s a business colleague?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the past, Chelsea Peretti's fans wondered <a href=#>why she stayed so quiet about her sudden exit from Brooklyn Nine-Nine</a>. Later on, Peretti explained that she remained mostly silent about the situation because she worried being outspoken would damage her career.</p><p>Since Chelsea Peretti was afraid to speak openly about her Brooklyn Nine-Nine exit, the fact that she was unsure about whether to be open about her relationship with Jordan Peele arguably says a lot.</p><p>Of course, Peretti is known for her sense of humor so she may have just been mocking the idea of explaining how she met Peele like they weren't in love at that time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the other hand, it is worth noting that in the years since that 2014 interview, Peretti has often seemed reluctant to talk about being married to Peele.</p><p>Right after Chelsea Perretti and Jordan Peele got married, she spoke about her husband briefly during talk show appearances but she typically avoids talking about Peele except in general terms.</p><p>With that in mind, there is a very good chance that Chelsea Peretti avoids talking about her husband because she worries being compared to Jordan Peele could damage her career. After all, the sad truth of the matter is that sexism often results in women in power couples being treated differently.</p><p>Think about it, how often is Blake Lively referred to as Ryan Reynolds' wife compared to how much he referred to as her husband?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqKqUlrtuvMSeo55lp56zpnnCoZylq5WWerGx0Z6rraFdp7KtrdOipqermJ69cA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./julia-roberts-best-movie-roles-20112710.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Julia Roberts' Best Movie Roles">&larr;
