He has three children: Ford, Finn, and Layla. However, <a href=#>Owen has been far more present for his boys</a> than his youngest child. For both of his sons, Owen was apparently very heavily involved during both the pregnancies and raising the kids with his exes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though he's private about his relationships and his children, Owen has spoken about both of his sons over the years, describing not just each child, but the relationship they share.</p><h3 id=update-2023-03-21-20-51-est-by-lane-vasquez>UPDATE: 2023/03/21 20:51 EST BY LANE VASQUEZ</h3><p><strong>Finn Lindqvist Wilson Is Owen's Middle Child</strong></p><p>Owen Wilson's son Finn followed the arrival of his oldest son Ford and came before Wilson's third child, Layla, whom he has never claimed. Owen is very active in Finn and Ford's lives, and often shares about them in interviews.</p><h2 id=owen-wilson-has-three-children>Owen Wilson Has Three Children</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/owen-wilson-daughters-movie.jpg><p>Wilson hasn't had luck when it comes to his love life. In 2011, Wilson had his first son Ford with his girlfriend, Jade Duell, but their relationship ended that same year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2014, he had his son Finn with Caroline Lindqvist, who is a personal trainer (she was also married at the time).</p><p>Four years later, Wilson had his third child, Layla, with Varunie Vongsvirates, but <a href=#>Varunie claims Owen continues to refuse to meet their daughter</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Is There More To The Story Of Owen Wilson's Daughter?">This Is Why Fans Think Owen Wilson Doesn't Want To See His Daughter</a></span></p><p>That same year, Vongsvirates told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a> that "Lyla needs a father." She noted, "It's ironic how [Owen] keeps getting these father roles, he's playing a father in his new movie, and he's never met his own daughter."</p><p>It does seem like he cared a lot about the births of his two boys, though. Concerning Finn's birth, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ETCanada</a> reported that "They [were] not living together, but Owen is involved [in the pregnancy]. He [came] to doctorâ€™s appointments and [made] sure Caroline is doing well."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=owen-39-s-kids-aren-39-t-impressed-that-he-39-s-lightning-mcqueen>Owen's Kids Aren't Impressed That He's Lightning McQueen</h2><p>When Finn was three, in 2017, Wilson told Jimmy Kimmel that both his sons were into sports. He said Ford was into karate, so he showed both his sons The Karate Kid, which they loved. Another reason why he showed them the classic film was to teach them respect and discipline.</p><p>Wilson also revealed that his boys are not impressed with him being the voice of Lightning McQueen in Cars. In fact, Wilson has a suspicion that they think he's delusional when he says he's the Disney character.</p><p>Wilson's upset that they're not more excited about it. "It's like this is my Fast & Furious. Let's get some energy going here," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wilson joked</a>.</p><p>"I do get some street cred from their classmates," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wilson told Ellen DeGeneres</a> about his Cars appearances.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="What Happened Between Owen Wilson And Marvel?">What Happened Between Owen Wilson And Marvel?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His kids must love Disney, anyway, because Finn was Mickey Mouse for Halloween that year. They showed a photo of him during another appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! that same year. Ford was Indiana Jones, and when Finn saw how cool his older brother looked, he said he was now "creepy Mickey Mouse."</p><p>When Kimmel asked him if he was a strike parent, Wilson said, "I'm pretty strict about manners and everything. But, yeah, you know, I'm not unreasonably strict. I guess I'm a little old-fashioned. You know, I've said to both of them, 'I don't care what Uncle Woody and what Uncle Willy do, there's no smoking pot in this house. My house, my rules."</p><p>Wilson also revealed that he hopes that his boys will be competitive for useful things, like getting good grades or being nicer to Wilson, but he thinks it will be the same between them as it is between him and his brothers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Wilson told Ellen DeGeneres that they call Finn "Me Too" because he always wants to do what his older brother is doing. Anything that Ford says, Finn hysterically laughs, but when Wilson makes a joke, "there are crickets," unless Ford laughs.</p><h2 id=owen-wilson-is-a-strict-parent-to-his-boys>Owen Wilson Is A Strict Parent To His Boys</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/owen-wilson-child-support.jpg><p>Wilson definitely knows that they aren't getting the same childhood as he had. His parents were even more easygoing than him. He grew up with no seatbelts, helmets, or sunscreen.</p><p>Now Wilson's boys are even older, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to a source for Us Weekly</a>, the actor has done a great job raising them with their mothers. "Owen has been a great father to his boys and has maintained a warm and close relationship with their mothers," the source said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Luke And Owen Wilson Dropped Out Of Ocean's Eleven And Looking Back, We Understand Why">Luke And Owen Wilson Dropped Out Of Ocean's Eleven And Looking Back, We Understand Why</a></span></p><p>Wilson had the boys for most of the time through the lockdown, so he probably had his hands full. But it's still weird that he <a href=#>doesn't seem to have a relationship with his daughter</a>.</p><p><a href=#>Owen also earned fan backlash after "opening up" about life as a single dad</a>, with fans dragging him for not being involved with his youngest child. While he was active in his boys' lives from day one, it seems that Wilson has a different relationship with Jade Duell and Caroline Lindqvist than he does (or did) with Varunie Vongsvirates.</p><p>Many think there's <a href=#>more to the story of why Owen chose not to be involved</a> in the raising of his daughter (though he does reportedly pay child support).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGimsJ2eYsSquNKopWarn6N6p7XNp2SloZ6Zvre10q1kq52clsGqu82sn6KoXaK8tbTEq2ScmaKkuaq6xGajoqaUpsOqv9No</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./truth-about-karlee-malone-karl-malones-daughter-615013-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Truth About Karlee Malone, Karl Malones Daughter">&larr;
