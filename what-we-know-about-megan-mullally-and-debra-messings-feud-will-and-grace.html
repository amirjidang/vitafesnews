For a while, fans believed everything was great between the cast and crew and that everyone was thrilled to work with each other again after 11 years of being off the air. However, it seems that wasn't exactly the case.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Towards the end of the second run, rumors started swirling about the drama between Messing and Mullally when Mullally took a temporary leave of absence from the series and missed filming two episodes. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TVLine reported that it was unclear why she took the time off</a>, but pointed out that it was, "Amid rumors of friction on the set between her and co-star Debra Messing."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Matt Damon Agreed To Will And Grace Because Of Sean Hayes, And He Didn't Need Much Convincing</a></span></p><p>Let's take a look at what we know about what happened between the two co-stars of the beloved series.</p><p>Updated July 17, 2023: Despite neither Megan Mullally, nor Debra Messing addressing their rumored feud outright, at the time of writing, it appears they're still not on speaking terms. There has been some progress, however, as Mullally and Sean Hayes have re-followed one another, and posted pictures of a friendly catch-up in June.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-unfollowed-each-other-on-instagram><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>They Unfollowed Each Other On Instagram</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/debra-messing-and-megan-mullally.jpg><p>Either Messing and Mullally unfollowed each other on Instagram, or one of them blocked the other. Either way, early in 2019, fans noticed that the two were no longer following each other on the social media platform and that's when the rumors started. Mullally and Eric McCormack also unfollowed one another - and at one point during that time, Mullally even unfollowed her other co-star - and bestie - Sean Hayes.</p><p>At the time of writing, she and Hayes have begun following each other once again. And, in June 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he posted an Instagram picture of them hanging out</a> and taking, "A moment to reconnect." Good to know that at least these two are on good terms!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-stopped-appearing-in-photos-together><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>They Stopped Appearing In Photos Together</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/debra-messing.jpg><p>During the final season of the reboot, Mullally and Messing failed to appear in photos together on social media, which just added to the rumors circulating about the feud. Messing often posted photos of her and <a href=#>her other two co-stars, Hayes</a> and McCormack, in their trailers on tape nights, but Mullally was noticeably missing from those photos. Fans even commented asking where Mullally was and why she wasn't in any of Messing's photos.</p><p>Unfortunately for anyone hoping for a scoop, however, Messing never alluded that anything was wrong.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's How Much The 'Will & Grace' Cast Was Paid Per Episode</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=eric-mccormack-denied-that-there-was-any-tension><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Eric McCormack Denied That There Was Any Tension</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/debra-messing-megan-mullally-and-eric-mccormack.jpg><p>McCormack told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">US Weekly in the fall of 2019 that "People worried... entirely too much"</a> about the whole Instagram situation. He claimed that, "The four of us [get] along like a house on fire, we always have." As such, when Messing didn't tag Mullally in an Instagram post, McCormack said the rumors were "Crazy." However, perhaps the reason Messing didn't tag Mullally is that she had been blocked by her, making it impossible for her to be tagged.</p><p>Perhaps McCormack was right, and the relationship really wasn't strained. However, there's also a chance he didn't want to add fuel to the fire and make things public.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=megan-talked-about-being-bullied-on-her-podcast><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Megan Talked About Being Bullied On Her Podcast</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/megan-mullally.jpg><p>On her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">podcast with her husband, Nick Offerman</a>, Mullally talked about being bullied. "I'm 60 and I'm being bullied right now," she said. She added that, "I've had a recent situation that I can't be specific about, but I had it happen, and I did try to stand up for myself in certain ways and that made it a thousand times worse." She also said that she's not good at standing up for herself or setting boundaries, but when she did stand up to this person, it "Lit a fire under that person where they just tripled their efforts and it got ... it can get very dangerous." She went on to say that it was a work situation, which of course led fans to believe she was talking about the one person she was already rumored to have tension with: Messing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mullally-said-she-lost-her-allies><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Mullally Said She Lost Her Allies</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/the-will-and-grace-cast.jpg><p>In the same podcast episode, Mullally claimed that she was, "Pretty much on my own in this situation because the bully has recruited many of my allies to their side, so that they're not my allies anymore." This would explain why she went through a period of not following McCormack or Hayes on Instagram.</p><p>She also failed to post photos of her with her cast when the others did. In fact, ever since the feud, Mullally hasn't been involved in any appearances with the cast. For instance, in October 2020, Hayes, McCormack and Messing took part in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a virtual conversation with Doug Jones</a> to help keep him in the senate. Mullally was not included in that. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The trio also took part in a virtual conversation earlier that month with Jill Biden</a>. Once again, Mullally wasn't included.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-source-confirmed-that-there-was-something-amiss><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>A Source Confirmed That There Was Something Amiss</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/debra-messing-1.jpg><p>Further driving the reports of this feud home? A source told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Radar Online that Messing and Mullally, "Are not on the greatest of terms"</a> and that, "They can't stand to be near each other, and it created an impossible atmosphere on the set." What's more, the same insider alleged that they'd never really been friends, and that as the show's ratings declined, so did their willingness to pretend otherwise.</p><p>The source suggested that this was the reason Mullally was missing from two episodes of the reboot. It is also worth noting that around the time Mullally either blocked or unfollowed Messing on Instagram, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she made a post on her story</a> with a caption saying, "One of the best feelings is finally losing your attachment to somebody who isn't good for you!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's sad that the two couldn't make things work, but maybe it's for the best. Messing herself is said to have posted a photo on Instagram of a quote saying, "May this day be the day to lead us to peace, to happiness, and to joy."</p><p>Wishing these two peace, no matter their friendship status.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYsSmecqnprBlkZe8tsCMppygmZ5iura4y5qjpbFdlrulecOemauZXaKytL%2FIp56sZZaawqV51qKjpWWRo7Fus9Gamp5n</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-are-matt-olson-parents-scott-and-lee-olson-family-background-and-more-facts-274667-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Are Matt Olson Parents Scott And Lee Olson?
