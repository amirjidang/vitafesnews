Despite their swoon-worthy courtship, which began when Kelce publicly confessed his interest in Swift in July 2023, their relationship has been surrounded by controversy. For example, two of Kelce's ex-girlfriends, Maya Benberry and Kayla Nicole, have condemned his previous actions, with Benberry saying he cheated on her and Nicole saying he was stingy regarding money.</p><p>Swift has also come under fire from critics who believe she has moved on too fast from her previous relationships with embattled rock star Matt Healy and actor Joe Alwyn. However, despite the criticism, Swift and Kelce have weathered the storm. But that hasn't stopped people from digging up any information they can find about the two, including a resurfaced interview in which Kelce named his ultimate celebrity crush, and it wasn't Taylor Swift!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=travis-kelce-admitted-a-famous-actress-was-his-celebrity-crush>Travis Kelce Admitted A Famous Actress Was His Celebrity Crush</h2><p>While<strong> Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift</strong>'s romance is in the beginning stages, in 2016, the football player was a young bachelor looking for love on the E!
