He has also made some controversial comments regarding rock and roll musicians, and has accrued new followers as well as some haters. He undoubtedly likes to cause waves, but that's just his public persona. As a father, however, he's a completely different person. He's thoughtful and caring, and maintains an amicable relationship with his daughter's mother.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Megan Fox Or Machine Gun Kelly, Who Has The Higher Net Worth?</a></span></p><p><a href=#>MGK has a daughter with his ex-girlfriend Emma Cannon</a>, and while the two of them broke up a long time ago, they have managed to stay on good terms for their kid's sake. Here, fans will learn more about Machine Gun Kelly's relationship with the mother of his child, how they co-parent, and what the girl's relationship with his dad is like.</p><h2 id=who-is-emma-cannon><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Who Is Emma Cannon?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There is little information about the mother of Machine Gun Kelly's daughter, but <a href=#>here's what we know about Emma Cannon.</a> She and MGK met when they were both very young, before the rapper started his successful music career. While the exact timeline of their relationship is unknown, they dated for a few years before the release of Lace Up, MGK's debut album, and parted ways amicably. Nowadays, Emma is committed to staying as out of the spotlight as possible. She has no known social media presence and is never seen at any of her ex's public appearances.</p><h2 id=when-was-their-daughter-born><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>When Was Their Daughter Born?</span></h2><p>MGK and Emma Cannon's daughter, Casie Colson Baker, was born in 2009, when the rapper was just 18 years old, and while it can't have been easy for either of them to take on the responsibilities of parenthood when they were just teenagers, they seem to have done an exceptionally good job.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Every Sweet Thing Machine Gun Kelly Has Said About Megan Fox</a></span></p><p>Going by Machine Gun Kelly's social media posts and interviews, his relationship with his daughter, who is now 12 years old, is amazing.</p><h2 id=how-machine-gun-kelly-and-emma-cannon-co-parent><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>How Machine Gun Kelly And Emma Cannon Co-Parent</span></h2><p>It's no secret that Machine Gun Kelly makes his daughter his greatest priority in life. Even with his extraordinarily busy schedule, he will always make time for her, as every parent should. Co-parenting is not always easy, but when both parents are on the same page, it makes everything a lot simpler. And MGK is proud to say that he and Emma share the same values when it comes to their kid.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MGK and Emma share common coparenting values and there aren’t any hard feelings between them</a>, which makes coparenting Casie fluid and easy," a source shared. "Their first and foremost priority is Casie’s happiness and well-being. That’s what counts."</p><h2 id=how-machine-gun-kelly-and-emma-cannon-manage-mgk-39-s-fame-when-it-comes-to-casie><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>How Machine Gun Kelly And Emma Cannon Manage MGK's Fame When It Comes To Casie</span></h2><p>When Machine Gun Kelly rose to fame, it became clear that Casie would not have a completely normal upbringing. That's probably why Emma is so private, because they need to give their daughter a sense of normalcy. That way, she can enjoy the nice aspects of fame with her dad without worrying about the consequences. With Casie's appearance at the 2021 American Music Awards, the question of whether or not they agreed on how she would approach her father's fame came up, and fans were reassured.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Reasons We Can't Get Enough Of Machine Gun Kelly And Megan Fox</a></span></p><p>"MGK and Emma are protective over Casie and at such a young age feel it’s important to shield her from the Hollywood scene," a source explained, "but she was dying to go to the AMA Awards so they mutually agreed to allow her attend."</p><h2 id=machine-gun-kelly-and-emma-cannon-remain-good-friends><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Machine Gun Kelly And Emma Cannon Remain Good Friends</span></h2><p>Machine Gun Kelly has always stated that he and Emma Cannon had parted ways amicably, and that much is clear from their great co-parenting dynamic and the fact that, as controversial as the rapper likes to be, there has never been any scandal surrounding his relationship with the mother of his child. That, added to the wholesome posts he makes honoring Emma on occasions such as Mother's Day, leads fans to believe that their relationship is not only cordial but also friendly. While that is not a must when it comes to exes, it's nice that they can maintain that kind of relationship, not only for Casie's sake but also because it's nice that, while they didn't work out as a couple, they can still remember each other fondly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mgk-39-s-new-relationship-with-megan-fox><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>MGK's New Relationship With Megan Fox</span></h2><p><a href=#>Machine Gun Kelly's relationship with Megan Fox</a><a href=#> has been talked about a lot recently</a>. They seem to be very much in love with each other, but how do their kids feel about that? Luckily, the answer is that both MGK's daughter with Emma and Megan's kids are happy with the situation.</p><p>"Megan and MGK are planning to transition into marriage pretty seamlessly," a source shared. "Her kids Bodhi, Journey and Noah think he’s super cool, and MGK’s daughter, Casie, simply adores Megan and her kids." While Emma's thoughts on the relationship are still not public, it seems that Megan's ex-husband is satisfied with the situation. "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The kids get along great, which is huge</a>.
