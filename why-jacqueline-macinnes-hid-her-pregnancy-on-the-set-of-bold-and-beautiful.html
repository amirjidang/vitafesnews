She appeared recently on an episode of The Talk to discuss the 9,000th episode of the soap opera which has been airing since 1987 and is still going strong. During her interview, Wood had been asked about her recent birthday trip to Las Vegas, and she had mentioned that her weekend getaway was not too wild.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This 'Bold And The Beautiful' Actor Sued The Biggest TV Producer Of All Time</a></span></p><p>When asked why, she revealed she was pregnant once again. The audience and co-hosts cheered and applauded as Wood playfully joked that it felt like she was always announcing a pregnancy every time she appeared on the show. Despite being pregnant, MacInnes is still committed to her work, particularly filming on the set of The Bold And Beautiful. But the question is how, and why does she keep her pregnancy hidden on show?</p><h2 id=when-did-jacqueline-macinnes-wood-join-the-bold-and-beautiful-cast>When Did Jacqueline MacInnes Wood Join The Bold And Beautiful Cast?</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jacqueline MacInnes Wood took on the character of Steffy Forrester on The Bold and the Beautiful, in 2008</a>. Steffy's storyline began with her returning from Europe as a young woman, getting a job in Forrester Creations' mailroom, and dating Marcus Walton. Since Wood took on the role, Steffy has been known for being a strong-willed and sometime a vixen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpg_20230609_203937_0000-1.jpg><p>Wood expressed how much she loved playing Steffy in 2011, mentioning how different the character is from herself and how it allows her to explore her alter ego on set every day. Although she temporarily left the show in 2013 allegedly to take some rest but made a comeback in 2015 and has continued portraying the character ever since, delighting fans of The Bold and the Beautiful.</p><p>Thanks to her impressive portrayal, Wood has earned a dedicated fan following and has been honored with two Daytime Emmy Awards. She won the award for Outstanding Lead Actress in The Bold and the Beautiful and another award in 2021 for her outstanding performance as the lead actress in a drama series, once again in The Bold and the Beautiful.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-many-babies-has-jacqueline-macinnes-had-on-the-bold-and-the-beautiful>How Many Babies Has Jacqueline MacInnes Had On The Bold And The Beautiful?</h2><p>Wood surprised her co-stars by revealing her first pregnancy on set. She chose a bold and beautiful moment to share the news: a scene where she walked down the catwalk in revealing lingerie. With enthusiasm, she exclaimed, "I just wanna let you all know: your girl is pregnant! I am pregnant!" Since her character, Steffy, had recently given birth on the show, the pregnancy was not written into the storyline.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpg_20230609_204019_0000-1.jpg><p>In October 2020, Wood made an Instagram post revealing her second pregnancy and showing off her baby bump. The pregnancy was then incorporated into the show's storyline in December. Steffy, her character, found out she was expecting her second child but was uncertain about whether the father was Liam Spencer, played by Scott Clifton.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Most Successful 'Bold And The Beautiful' Stars, Ranked By Current Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Wood, in November 2021, happily shared another pregnancy news with People. She and her husband were going to have their third child. She revealed they had always dreamed of having a big family since they both were the only children their parents had and were ecstatic about achieving that.</p><p>Wood continued working as much as possible during her pregnancy and during an interview with ET, she revealed that she planned to film right up until she gives birth. However, the pregnancy was not written into the show. Just as mentioned earlier, Wood is reportedly pregnant with her fourth child still on the show.</p><h2 id=why-jacqueline-macinnes-wood-hid-her-pregnancy-on-the-bold-and-the-beautiful>Why Jacqueline MacInnes Wood Hid Her Pregnancy On The Bold and The Beautiful</h2><p><a href=#>Jacqueline MacInnes Wood just like many other stars have filmed during their pregnancies</a>, and her current pregnancy is no exception. The reason for this is, her character Steffy Forrester is not supposed to appear pregnant. The show presented a special episode focused solely on her character.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This was revealed during an episode of The Talk where Natalie, the host, mentioned that Wood's character had an important and exciting storyline, prompting the actress to spill some details.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpg_20230609_203701_0000.jpg><p>Wood's fourth pregnancy might not be shown on-screen and won't be a part of the storyline considering the fact that she hides it on set. Similar to what has been done before, when the time comes for her to give birth, her character can be conveniently sent out of town for Forrester’s business. This way, her pregnancy can be discreetly managed without affecting the show's plot.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=here-39-s-how-jacqueline-macinnes-wood-hides-her-pregnancy-on-the-bold-and-the-beautiful>Here's How Jacqueline MacInnes Wood Hides Her Pregnancy On The Bold And The Beautiful</h2><p>During an interview with ET, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wood shared her secret to hiding her pregnancy while working on set of The Bold and the Beautiful</a>. She gave a grand tour of the luxurious set, including Steffy's beach house, all while sporting a comfy gray sweatsuit. The show's producers had cleverly found exciting ways to hide MacInnes’s growing baby bump.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpg_20230609_203828_0000-1.jpg><p>She proudly revealed her baby bump by standing up, but then quickly sat back down to assure everyone that her pregnancy wouldn't interfere with her role. To create the illusion of a non-pregnant character, she cleverly positions herself behind a table and discreetly keeps her hands in her pockets.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Lesley-Anne Down Was Almost Kidnapped & 9 Other Facts About 'The Bold And The Beautiful' Star</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Wood humorously mentioned that she often talks with her hands, but the production team reminds her when her belly is visible.
