In this article, we'll take a look at the lighter side, examining what goes on with the food that the cast is typically eating during takes on the show.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Marisa Tomei Auditioned For The Big Bang Theory, But What Did She Really Think Of The Script?</a></span></p><h2 id=fake-eating-scenes-were-extremely-common-during-the-big-bang-theory>Fake Eating Scenes Were Extremely Common During The Big Bang Theory</h2><p>Throughout the duration of the series, we saw several scenes of the cast eating, whether it be at Penny's apartment, Leonard and Sheldon's place, the Cheesecake Factory or even at the cafeteria. The communal nature of sharing a meal was a staple in the hit sitcom, but it posed a challenge for the actors and actresses. With so many takes of the same scene, the stars were forced to find unique ways to pretend eat what was in front of them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/a-sitcom-copied-the-big-bang-theory-and-it-almost-resulted-in-an-expensive-lawsuit.jpg><p>Alongside Screenrant, Raj even issued some tips on <a href=#>how he was able to sneakily fake eat the food</a>, "Nayyar even demonstrated (via Conan) some of the techniques they use while filming an eating scene on The Big Bang Theory. One of his tips included putting the food back into the containers after fake chewing."</p><p>According to a fan on Quora, <a href=#>the show was also very tactical with its food choices</a>. Something like rice, which was often on the show, is easy to get rid of between takes, showing the characters are actually consuming the food. Using takeout containers was also tactical, as the high sides of the boxes sheild the audience from the actual food. The stars don't actually have to take a single bite. "That’s why they eat a lot of Chinese food and salads. They can move food around with their forks (or chopsticks) and never actually ingest or remove any, allowing faster movement from take to take."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Based On The Big Bang Theory Salaries, Kevin Sussman Was The Most Underpaid Of The Cast</a></span></p><p>"You don’t see them eating a lot (if any) hamburgers (the most common meal in America). If an actor took a bite out of a hamburger in one take of the scene, they would need to do it again in every take because footage from multiple takes of a long scene can be edited together."</p><p>Most of the cast kept the matter quiet, however, as fake-eating is not exactly a glamorous topic. Kaley Cuaco, who played Penny, went a little more in depth via Instagram.</p><h2 id=kaley-cuoco-revealed-that-she-would-actually-eat-her-lunch-during-the-takes>Kaley Cuoco Revealed That She Would Actually Eat Her Lunch During The Takes</h2><p>New mom Kaley Cuoco revealed some interesting information via IG back in the fall of 2018. According to the actress who portrays the role of Penny, not only was the food very much real, but when she knew there was an eating scene, Cuoco would eat less during the day. She enjoyed the food they served on the show, and she wanted to be able to enjoy some of it for real.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/kaley-cuoco-eating-big-bang-theory.png><p>In this particular behind the scenes clip, she's shown actually eating at the end of take. She stated, "If you ever wanted to know what happens during our ‘dinner’ scenes, here are two videos that show the before and after . I always forgo lunch if I know we are shooting an eating scene like this one lol when you watch TONIGHT’s all new @bigbangtheory_cbs episode, you will know I was quite satisfied. Notice our crew cleaning up the props and throwing things away. The cast is moving on with their day. The scene is done. I’m wrapped. Time to go home."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Big Bang Theory Producers Didn't Give Penny A Last Name For A Superstitious Reason</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans enjoyed the unique behind the scenes visual, however, they took exception to the amount of food that wasn't consumed, starting an entirely different problem in itself. There was quite a bit of food on standby in case it was needed, and fans were worried it was all wasted.</p><h2 id=the-big-bang-theory-production-team-donated-the-leftover-food>The Big Bang Theory Production Team Donated The Leftover Food</h2><p>Fans really don't miss much and in the comments section of the clip, Cuoco's followers weren't exactly thrilled with all the food that wasn't consumed and for the garbage. The backlash caused Cuoco to edit the post, stating that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the leftovers weren't thrown away and instead donated</a>, particularly the food that was untouched.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/priya-big-bang.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"FYI that food had been eaten, touched and worked with all day. We save all food and give away all uneaten leftovers at the end of shoot days."</p><p>Cuoco really didn't need to address that matter, but it just goes to show how much she cares, especially about the sitcom. In truth, Cuoco wasn't ready to let go at the time and still, she talks about the possibility of a reboot in the future. Hopefully, if one is to take place, we'll have more eating scenes!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrGqsIytn55lkp60bq7Ap55mrJiavLPFjKmpqJylmMGqu81mmqudp2KxsHnWoquhZZyas7W71Z6prGWVlsGmuoybsGasmJp6pK3SrWSdraKeu6h50pycp52jZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./did-courteney-cox-like-being-in-scream.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Does Courteney Cox Say About Her Time On 'Scream'?">&larr;
