I thought they were so fun. I didn’t like the way they affected my kids,” Brady, 46, said during a Tuesday, May 14, appearance on the “Pivot Podcast.”</p><p>He continued: “It’s the hardest part about … like, the bittersweet aspect of when you do something that you think is one way and then all of a sudden you realize, ‘I wouldn’t do that again because of the way that it affected actually the people that I care about the most in the world.’”</p><p>Brady shares son Benjamin, 14, and daughter Vivian, 11, with ex-wife <strong>Gisele Bündchen</strong> and son Jack, 16, with ex-girlfriend <strong>Bridget Moynahan</strong>. The retired quarterback’s relationships with both Bündchen, 43, and Moynahan, 53, were the subject of jabs during <a href=#>The Roast of Tom Brady</a>, which premiered live on May 5.</p><p>“Jesus Christ, Tom. One of the smartest quarterbacks who ever played the game. How did you not see this coming? Eight f–king karate classes a day. … Eight karate classes a day and she’s still a white belt,” <strong>Kevin Hart</strong> joked, referring to <a href=#>Bündchen’s romance</a> with martial arts instructor <strong>Joaquim Valente</strong>. “F–k Tom. The only bruises she had were on her ass. Everybody should have known it.”</p><p><strong>Nikki Glaser</strong>, meanwhile, poked fun at Brady’s 2006 split from then-pregnant Moynahan.</p><p>“Tom, you’re the best to ever play for too long, you retired then came back then retired, I get it … It’s hard to walk away from something that isn’t your pregnant girlfriend,” Glaser, 39, said. “To be fair, he didn’t know. He just thought she was getting fat.”</p><p>Brady said on Tuesday that he thinks the roast experience was “a good lesson” for him as a parent.</p><p>“I’m going to be a better parent as I go forward because of it. At the same time, I’m happy everyone who was there had a lot of fun,” he said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Tom-Brady-Says-Roast-Affected-My-Kids-I-Wouldn-t-Do-That-Again-068.jpg><p>The athlete also explained what made him want to do the roast in the first place.</p><p>“I love when people are making fun of me. I always said when I was going through the Deflategate stuff that I watched three things on TV: Premier League soccer, golf and comedy shows,” said Brady, who was <a href=#>suspended from four games</a> during the 2016 NFL season after allegedly deliberately deflating footballs that were used in a 2015 New England Patriots winning game. “Every time I turned on SportsCenter it was like, ‘Are you f—king kidding me?’ I just want to laugh.”</p><p>Brady’s kids weren’t the only ones affected by the comedy special. Bündchen, who was married to Brady from 2009 to 2022, was “offended and upset about the comments made at the roast,” a source exclusively told Us Weekly earlier this week.</p><p>The insider noted that while the model “is aware that it comes with the territory of a roast,” she “didn’t think there were going to be that many remarks made about her and especially her new relationship” with Valente, whom she began dating in the summer of 2023.</p><p>Brady “<a href=#>did reach out to Gisele</a> to apologize to her,” the source added.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>A second insider told Us that “just like with any roast, neither Tom nor any of the participants knew what was going to be said about them” ahead of time.</p><p>“But as with any roast, they target public parts of your life,” the source continued. “Their kids were always off limits. Everything was all in good fun.”</p><p>The Roast of Tom Brady is now streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuopV2Xv6Kw2GapqJmjqXqissWemq2dlGK1qr%2BMbGSkoZSoeqmxjLCmrqSUo8FusM5mq6GZpGKuqK3Ip2Y%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./tommy-clufetos-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-328271-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tommy Clufetos Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr;
