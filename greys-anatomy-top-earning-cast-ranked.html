Below, we look at some of the top-earning actors to grace Grey’s Anatomy, both past and present. Of course, it’s not surprising who ended up in first place.</p><h2 id=kevin-mckidd---83-000-per-episode>Kevin McKidd - $83,000 Per Episode</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kevin-McKidd.jpg> Via Wikimedia Commons <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kevin McKidd plays the tough-as-nails Owen Hunt on Grey’s Anatomy, a role he’s been in since season two. The actor’s official salary is unknown. But in 2020, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a> reported that McKidd was one of several Grey’s actors who received significant salary raises. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a> pegs the actor as worth $2 million, so assuming that’s his yearly salary and he makes 24 episodes per season, McKidd is likely bringing in around $83,000 per episode. However, since he’s been on the show for so long, it’s possible he’s making even more.</p><h2 id=camilla-luddington---83-000-per-episode>Camilla Luddington - $83,000 Per Episode</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-8.31.22-AM.png> Via Wikimedia Commons <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Based on available information, it appears Camilla Luddington is making a similar salary to her co-star Kevin McKidd. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a> reports the actress is worth $2 million. Deadline also mentioned she was one of the actors to get a raise in 2020. If her overall salary for playing Dr. Jo Wilson is $2 million per season and they make 24 episodes in one season, she’s likely making $83,000 per season. However, Luddington has only played a recurring character since season nine. Therefore, it’s likely that McKidd makes more than her given his seniority.</p><h2 id=t-r-knight---125-000>T.R. Knight - $125,000</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/T.R.-Knight.jpg> Via Wikimedia Commons<p>T.R. Knight played Dr. George O’Malley until his surprising exist after the show’s fifth season. In 2007, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reuters</a> reported that he was amongst a handful of cast members who received a raise following the show’s critical acclaim. He was reportedly making $125,000 per episode. It was possible the actor could’ve been earning even more at the time of his departure.</p><h2 id=chandra-wilson---125-000-per-episode-at-least>Chandra Wilson - $125,000 Per Episode (At Least)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Chandra-Wilson.jpg> Via Wikimedia Commons <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chandra Wilson has been portraying Dr. Miranda Bailey since Grey’s first season. Style Caster explains that it was reported in 2007 that actress was making $125,000 per episode. More than ten years later, it’s extremely likely the actress is receiving a higher price per episode. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a> notes her net worth is $10 million.</p><h2 id=james-pickens-jr---125-000-per-episode-at-least>James Pickens Jr. - $125,000 Per Episode (At Least)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/James-Pickens-Jr..jpg> Via Wikimedia Commons<p>James Pickens Jr., who has played Dr. Richard Webber since Grey’s first season, was one of the actors reported to be making $125,000 per episode in 2007 by Reuters. His pay per episode has likely gone up significantly in the last fourteen years given his seniority. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a> notes his net worth is $13 million.</p><h2 id=jesse-williams---260-000-per-episode-approx>Jesse Williams - $260,000 Per Episode (Approx.)</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dr. Jackson Avery is portrayed by American actor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jesse Williams</a>. It’s unclear exactly how much the actor earns per episode. But <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a> notes that his income was reported as $6.25 million during his 2017 divorce. Grey’s Anatomy usually releases twenty-four episodes per season. This means he was roughly making $260,000 per episode at the time. That number could be higher now.</p><h2 id=sandra-oh---350-000-per-episode>Sandra Oh - $350,000 Per Episode</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Sandra-Oh.jpg> Via Wikimedia Commons<p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sandra Oh</a> played the beloved Dr. Cristina Yang during seasons one through ten. In 2012, shortly before her departure, it reported that the actress was earning a cool $350,000 per episode, Style Caster notes. This was reportedly the same salary Ellen Pompeo and Patrick Dempsey were earning at the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=justin-chambers---350-000-per-episode>Justin Chambers - $350,000 Per Episode</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Justin-Chambers.jpg> Via Wikimedia Commons<p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a> reports that Chamber earns $9 million per season for portraying Dr. Alex Karev on Grey’s Anatomy. This works out to be approximately $350,000, the same salary as his former co-star Sandra Oh was making in 2012. This suggests that Justin was making less than his fellow co-stars, including Pompeo and Dempsey, despite also playing a character from the original season.</p><h2 id=patrick-dempsey---400-000-per-episode>Patrick Dempsey - $400,000 Per Episode</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Patrick-Dempsey.jpg> Via Wikimedia Commons <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Patrick Dempsey’</a>s character Derek Shepherd was shockingly killed off from the show in 2015. At the time, however, the actor was reportedly earning $400,000 per episode. He later returned to Grey’s to reprise the role at the beginning of season seventeen during a dream sequence, though it’s unclear how much his temporary appearances earned him per episode.</p><h2 id=ellen-pompeo---575-000-per-episode>Ellen Pompeo - $575,000 Per Episode</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Ellen-Pompeo.jpg> Via Wikimedia Commons<p>While Grey’s Anatomy revolves around many characters, its true main character is Meredith Grey. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ellen Pompeo</a> has been playing the lead since its first season, so it’s no wonder she makes the most out of all the cast. Style Caster reports that the actress earns a whopping $575,000 per episode or $20 million per season. Her net worth to date is an estimated $40 million.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">11 Casting Decisions That Saved Grey's Anatomy (And 16 Mistakes Fans Still Can't Get Over)</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Style Caster</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reuters</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a>,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS0s7HYrGSappGpvK7FjK2mqWWVlr%2Bvtc2gZJyZo6l6s63NpJydZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./15-times-nikki-bella-revealed-too-much.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Times Nikki Bella Revealed TOO Much">&larr;
