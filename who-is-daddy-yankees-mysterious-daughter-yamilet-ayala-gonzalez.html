Some fans call him the King of Reggaeton, a genre that's become insanely popular over the last decade. Everyone from Justin Bieber to Drake has taken their swings at the genre that dominates the airwaves in Latin America.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Daddy Yankee is also the musician that put one of the biggest songs of all time on the map, his collaboration with Luis Fonsi in the song 'Despacito'. Sure, <a href=#>Justin Bieber hopping on the remix</a> certainly helps. However, it's undeniable that the retired Daddy Yankee may have been the biggest reason for the songs enormous success.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Daddy Yankee Shocks Fans With Retirement Announcement</a></span></p><p>All of this success has brought attention to Daddy Yankee's private life. While he and his family aren't on reality shows, his family isn't quite off the grid. He just doesn't showcase them, because to him his family is a "little treasure" that's only for him.</p><p>There is one family member who lives a completely private lifestyle, and that's Daddy Yankee's oldest daughter Yamilet Ayala. Considering that her dad is super famous, and her siblings aren't a closed book at all, it can be a little odd that Yamilet lives the way she does.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here's everything to know...</p><h2 id=who-is-yamilet-ayala-gonzalez>Who Is Yamilet Ayala Gonzalez?</h2><p>When it comes to investigating someone with a private life, there tends to be more rumors than actual facts.</p><p>The problem there is that, with Yamilet, there really aren't many confirmed facts. Her age isn't even official. Some sources believe she is 26, while others believe she is closer to 28 years old.</p><p>Daddy Yankee hasn't spoken about Yamilet much, but what he has said has been positive. In 2013, he posted on Facebook that she graduated from high school. It's not clear if Yamilet has ever attended any colleges.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Speaking of social media, Yamilet has no confirmed profiles. At least any that's public for fans to follow. Participating in social media <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">has been proven</a> to have negative effects on one's mental health. Maybe Yamilet does have some social media profiles for her friends and family, but not having everything publicly must do wonders for someone that has famous family members.</p><h2 id=everything-to-know-about-daddy-yankee-39-s-family>Everything To Know About Daddy Yankee's Family</h2><p>For the longest time, Daddy Yankee has been married. His wife is Mireddys Gonzalez, who he's been married to since 1995. This information is not common knowledge, once again due to the rapper wanting to keep his private life separate from his public life. Daddy Yankee's successful marriage seems to be the inspiration for his romantic songs such as 'Despacito' or 'Gasolina'.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Despacito Tops The List Of YouTubeâ€™s Most Popular Videos Of The Decade!</a></span></p><p>Yamilet is Daddy Yankee and Mireddy's first child together. They had two other children, giving Yamilet a sister in Jesaaelys and a brother in Jeremy. Those two certainly live a more famous lifestyle than Yamilet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jeremy has over 300,000 followers on Instagram and has followed in his father's footsteps by becoming a music producer. Meanwhile, Jesaaelys has become a social media influencer, and has a whopping 1.5 million followers on Instagram.</p><p>As proven time and time again, Daddy Yankee very clearly loves his family. He posted to social media <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an appreciation post</a> about his African-American father, in order to show respect to George Floyd. That's what Daddy Yankee uses his fame for, when regarding his family - he just wants to publicly show them his appreciation. He doesn't want the reality show type of family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That seems to be for a good reason. Just look at the royal family. Their support and adoration <a href=#>have declined</a> over the years. The Kardashian family is the most famous in the world at this point, but it's far from the most loved. While being super famous might bring more money and attention, it can be at the cost of mental health.</p><h2 id=why-does-yamilet-ayala-gonzalez-live-such-a-private-life>Why Does Yamilet Ayala Gonzalez Live Such A Private Life?</h2><p>It can seem quite odd that the daughter of a rather confident rapper can live a private life. Daddy Yankee's confidence is reflected by his stage name, his jewelry, the lyrics in his music. The guy was confident enough to try out for the Seattle Mariners, according to MTV.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's How Daddy Yankee Came Up With His Stage Name</a></span></p><p>However, just because someone lives a private life, doesn't mean they lack confidence. Fame comes with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a huge downside of anxieties and fears</a>, and Yamilet likely doesn't want to get herself tangled up in all of that. Growing up the daughter of a superstar, maybe she saw the positives and negatives of fame firsthand. Assuming she looks up to her dad, she saw his preference for keeping his life private and took inspiration from him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/daddy-yankee-left-and-janet-jackson-right.jpg><p>She's not the only daughter of a world-famous musician to keep her life private, either. Chris Daughtry's late stepdaughter Hannah also <a href=#>lived a very private lifestyle</a> before her unfortunate passing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBusMCdm7JlqZa7rLHErGSmsaOpsrO1zq6qZpyRqrSpwMSrZLKZnZ65psCMmrCapJFitLC62ZqjnrJf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./sebastian-stan-almost-canceled-because-his-girlfriend.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fans Say Sebastian Stan Was Almost Canceled Because Of His Girlfriend">&larr;
