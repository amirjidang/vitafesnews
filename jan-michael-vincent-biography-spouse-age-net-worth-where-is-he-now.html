actor caught the attention of prominent players in the industry in his early days and this ensured his rapid rise in popularity throughout the 70’s and 80’s.</span></p><p><span>Vincent is best known for his role in the series&nbsp;</span><span>Airwolf</span><span>&nbsp;as Stringfellow Hawke, a helicopter pilot, he is also known for his role in the late ’70s film&nbsp;</span><span>Big Wednesday</span><span>&nbsp;The actor retired from acting too early and you’ll soon find out why.&nbsp;First off, here’s everything you need to know about him.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jan-michael-vincent-biography-age></span><strong><span>Jan-Michael Vincent Biography, age</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>He was born on July 15, 1944 to Doris Vincent(mother) and Lloyd Vincent (father).&nbsp;Vincent may not have had big dreams of being in the Hollywood scenes, but a talent scout who discovered him while he was in the California Army National Guard saw great potential in him.&nbsp;Jan-Michael Vincent’s looks and aura were all he needed to draw the Scout’s attention, and the rest became history.&nbsp;He soon appeared in&nbsp;</span><span>The Bandits</span><span>&nbsp;(1967) and landed several other small film roles as well.</span></p><p><span>Sooner than later, he was inducted into Universal Studios with the influence of casting agent Dick Clayton.&nbsp;He then landed a starring role in the soap opera&nbsp;</span><span>The Survivors</span><span>, which was later cancelled.&nbsp;Also in the late ’60s, Jan-Michael appeared in&nbsp;</span><span>Journey to Shiloh</span><span>&nbsp;and also in&nbsp;</span><span>Danger Island</span><span>, and the then-popular Hanna-Barbera TV show,&nbsp;</span><span>The Banana Splits Adventure Hour</span><span>&nbsp;The actor has been seen in&nbsp;</span><span>The Undefeated</span><span>&nbsp;alongside other notable actors such as Lee Meriwether, the late Merlin Olsen and John Wayne.</span></p><p><span>Jan-Michael Vincent was engaged in notable roles in prominent films in the 70’s.&nbsp;He is best known for his role in the TV movie&nbsp;</span><span>Tribes</span><span>&nbsp;Vincent starred as Buster Lane in the 1974 film&nbsp;</span><span>Buster and Billie</span><span>&nbsp;and attracted a lot of attention with the showcase of his frontal nudes in the film.&nbsp;He was notable for his performance in the film,&nbsp;</span><span>Big Wednesday</span><span>&nbsp;where he starred alongside William Katt and Gary Busey.</span></p><p><span>Jan-Michael starred in the 80s&nbsp;</span><span>Despite</span><span>&nbsp;starring alongside Danny Aiello in the sci-fi&nbsp;</span><span>The Return</span><span>, he also starred in the action film Take It&nbsp;</span><span>Out</span><span>&nbsp;(1983).&nbsp;Jan-Michael Vincent became a cast member of the notable action series Airwolf, which aired from 1984-1987.&nbsp;He played the remarkable role of Stringfellow Hawke, which remains his best to date.&nbsp;However, the ’90s and 2000s weren’t very busy for Vincent, despite appearing in many low-budget films.</span></p><p><span>He starred in&nbsp;</span><span>Raw Nerve</span><span>&nbsp;in 1991 and also appeared in the comedy horror&nbsp;</span><span>Ice Cream Vendor</span><span>&nbsp;(1996) along with Clint Howard.&nbsp;The actor ended his acting career with the independent film W&nbsp;</span><span>Hello Boy</span><span>&nbsp;which was released in 2003.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=his-capital></span><strong><span>His capital</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Not much is known about Jan-Michael Vincent’s financial status as he retired from the acting business a long time ago.&nbsp;Though many characters have appeared on different platforms, none of them are accurate as the actor hasn’t been very vocal about his endeavors lately.&nbsp;But let’s not forget that Vincent made a lot of money in his playing days.</span></p><p><span>A good way to gauge just how wealthy Jan-Michael Vincent is was in his prime when we put his publicly known $200,000 per episode salary into perspective when he landed the role of Stringfellow Hawke on the action series Airwolf played.&nbsp;It was indeed a lot of money at the time and Vincent was considered the highest paid actor at the time.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jan-michael-vincents-personal-life-%e2%80%93-spouse-children></span><strong><span>Jan-Michael Vincent’s personal life – spouse, children</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Jan-Michael Vincent may be retired, but that doesn’t stop the media from snooping into his life for juicy stories.&nbsp;The actor has been in a number of relationships, most of which didn’t end well.&nbsp;He was married to Bonnie Poorman in 1968.&nbsp;The couple welcomed a daughter, Amber Vincent, in 1972.&nbsp;However, five years after the birth of their daughter, they separated in 1977.</span></p><p><span>Vincent then married Joanne Robinson in1986.&nbsp;In 1998, however, it was revealed that Robinson had issued a restraining order against him citing abuse.&nbsp;These unfortunate events must have stemmed from the actor’s Alcoholism/Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) and substance abuse problems that got Jan-Michael Vincent in trouble with the law for years.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-is-he-now></span><strong><span>Where is he now?</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Jan-Michael Vincent is no longer seen in films or television series, as long as he left the big screens.&nbsp;It looks like the actor has taken care of his impending screen exit, all thanks to his self-destructive behavior, which has included substance abuse and a string of assaults against women.</span></p><p><span>The actor had his right leg amputated in 2012 after complications from peripheral artery disease caused a severe infection.&nbsp;He now has a prosthetic right leg and sometimes uses a wheelchair.</span></p><p class=postsid
