Which has many people <a href=#>wondering whether the show is scripted</a>. But some things are real; castmates Evelyn Lozada and Ogom Chijindu AKA OG, have been involved in a feud since 2019.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The feud escalated beyond onscreen banter and saw the duo filed lawsuits against each other. There were colorism, racism, and defamation claims made which left fans divided.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Much Is OG 'Basketball Wives' Star Shaunie O'Neal Worth?</a></span></p><p>Evelyn and OG have engaged in heated arguments on the show and have called each other unpleasant names. The Basketball Wives are no strangers to controversy and negative publicity. Like the time a Basketball Wives star accused her caste mate of <a href=#>having an affair with Michael Jordan</a>.</p><p>Lozada and Chijindu's lawsuits against each other are still ongoing, and that means the drama between the castmates is not simmering down anytime soon.</p><h2 id=a-toe-39-joke-39-started-their-feud>A Toe 'Joke' Started Their Feud</h2><p>From the moment Ogom Chijindu aka OG joined the cast of Basketball Wives, there was drama between her and original cast member Evelyn Lozada. OG joined the show in its seventh season, and the eighth season is when things went wrong.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In one episode, Evelyn made fun of OG's toes and called her "Toe G." She told their castmates that OG's toes were hanging out of her heels, which OG took offense to.</p><p>Things between the two got even worse when Evelyn called OG ugly and the latter provided evidence proving that Evelyn's ex-husband Chad Johnson had tried to get with her.</p><p>In the end, OG accused Evelyn of racism and colorism, accusations that Evelyn denied. She stated that she is Afro Latina and has two children of African and Hispanic descent, therefore negating the racism claims against her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She also reportedly pointed out that she was chairperson for a foundation that raised money for abused women. Not only that, but she also raised thousands for the Sauti Yeti Center for African women.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In an interview with B. Scott,</a> Lozada said, "I have never made comments about this person’s skin color, race, or anything that should ever make it accurate or appropriate to label me a colorist or a racist. On the other hand, it’s been said by this person that I’m not Black, so I can’t wear braids."</p><p>Fans called Evelyn out on this because aside from calling her ugly, she also used a monkey GIF to describe OG on Instagram once. It's easy to see why that could be portrayed as a colorist and racist. That's the post that OG referenced when she made the racism claims against Evelyn.</p><h2 id=evelyn-sued-og-for-defamation>Evelyn Sued OG For Defamation</h2><p>Following Ogom's accusations, Evelyn filed a lawsuit against her. According to her, OG's accusations caused her emotional distress and resulted in her losing endorsements.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Evelyn also filed a restraining order against her castmate, which the judge denied. Per reports, it was denied because she already had a defamation lawsuit against OG. The restraining order could be handled within the defamation lawsuit.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Most High Profile Defamation Lawsuits In Hollywood History</a></span></p><p>Many people weren't as sympathetic to Evelyn's claims of emotional distress and loss of endorsements that OG's claims allegedly caused. This is owing to the fact that Lozada has previously been accused of bullying her castmates.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She once referred to her castmate Cece Gutierrez as "Lee Lee". Cece is Filipino and fans took offense to the jab, which many considered to be racially motivated. There was even a petition started to get Lozada kicked off Basketball Wives.</p><p>After the backlash, Evelyn issued a public apology in which she acknowledged wrongdoing.</p><h2 id=og-counter-sued-evelyn>OG Counter Sued Evelyn</h2><p>Following Evelyn's lawsuit against her, Ogom filed her own against the former. According to the suit, Lozada's lawsuit caused OG a medical scare. She alleged that she suffered severe chest pain and had to visit the ER.</p><p>She also accused Lozada of having a tendency to file lawsuits for media attention and financial gain. The lawsuits are ongoing, and neither Evelyn nor OG seems to have had a change of heart.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some people can't understand why OG won't let it go and just move on. The professional athlete and reality star has also been accused of having a negative attitude and stirring the pot.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 High Profile Celebrity Lawsuits You Completely Forgot About</a></span></p><p>Per Urban Belle Mag, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">OG gave an update about the lawsuits</a> during an interview with Storm Monroe.</p><p>She revealed, "It’s still ongoing, so I can’t talk too much about it because it’s still ongoing. We are entering different stages due to Covid. And the level of lawsuit that was filed against me, it was not considered high on the protocol, high on standards, so the courts are closed."</p><p>She went on to say, "So everything had to be done during Zoom and different things like that, so it kind of got pushed on the back burner. Which sucks because I’m kind of sitting here with a pending lawsuit."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>OG concluded, "And because of that lawsuit I had to file a counter lawsuit to protect myself, and it’s kind of like just this little cloud looming. But I’ll be victorious in the end, so I’m just riding out the process."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>10 Little-Known Facts About 'Love & Hip Hop's' Erica Mena And Safaree's Relationship And Divorce</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicr52crrtuuM6zmJ2ZXaS0bq7ArKKerJKWua151qKtnqtdm7%2Bqsc2dqqGhoGKyr7HMopysZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ben-affleck-receives-lackluster-response-to-his-tom-brady-roast.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ben Affleck Receives Lackluster Response to His Tom Brady Roast">&larr;
