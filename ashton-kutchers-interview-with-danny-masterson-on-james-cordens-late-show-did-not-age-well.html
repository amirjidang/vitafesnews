After the show came to an end in 2006, many of its stars went on to have a successful career, including <a href=# rel=nofollow>Topher Grace</a>, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Ashton Kutcher</a>, and <a href=# rel=nofollow>Mila Kunis</a>. However, not all of the That '70s Show cast had the same luck.</p><p>Most recently, Danny Masterson, who portrayed Steven Hyde in this popular sitcom, was <a href=# rel=nofollow>sentenced to 30 years in prison</a> after he was found guilty of multiple counts of forcible rape.</p><p>At the time the first allegations against Masterson went viral, both his That 70s Show co-stars and the fans were shocked. However, internet users have pointed out that several of Masterson’s old interviews hint at the actor’s criminal activities. For instance, fans think that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Conan O’Brien tried to warn people of Masterson's predatory behavior in an old interview</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Likewise, a 2016 interview with James Corden and Ashton Kutcher didn’t age well for the now-convicted actor.</p><h2 id=an-old-interview-of-ashton-kutcher-and-danny-masterson-talking-about-their-party-days-didn-rsquo-t-age-well>An Old Interview of Ashton Kutcher and Danny Masterson Talking About Their Party Days Didn’t Age Well</h2><p>Back in 2016, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Ashton Kutcher and Danny Masterson appeared on The Late Late Show</a> with James Corden to promote the upcoming season of The Ranch. When this interview resurfaced, after Masterson had been sentenced to prison for sexual assault, fans couldn’t help but notice that the memories <a href=# rel=nofollow>Kutcher shared in this interview didn’t paint Masterson in a positive light</a>.</p><p>During the interview, Kutcher revealed that, back in their That 70s Show days, the two used to go out practically every night. "We took a night off a week," Masterson added. "We took a night off. We had to shoot our show."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/danny-masterson-and-mila-kunis-that-70s-show.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>An Interview Where Mila Kunis Called Ashton Kutcher "Dumb" Saved Her Image From The Danny Masterson Trial</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Fans praised Mila Kunis for being "honest" about "dumb" Ashton Kutcher after seeking leniency for Danny Masterson's rape sentence.</span><p>Moreover, Kutcher explained that Masterson “had all the hookups.”</p><p>"He'd been here. Grew up in the whole thing," Kutcher explained. "This pre-TMZ, pre-cell phone camera, so you could go out." The actor then went on to explain what this was like. "Nobody was going to take your picture so you could really wild out and nobody would know what you did last night," he said.</p><p>While Kutcher was only trying to remember the good old times, fans have pointed out that this interview didn’t age well at all. After all, the counts of rape for which Masterson was sentenced probably took place around this time. Moreover, the fact that Kutcher used to go out with Masterson regularly has led some fans to believe that maybe the Just Married star knew what his That 70s Show co-star really was up to back in the day.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/danny-masterson-s-net-worth-plummeted-compared-to-his-that-70s-show-co-stars-front-deposit-back-that-70_s-show-_youtube.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Danny Masterson's Net Worth Plummeted Compared To His That '70s Show Co-Stars</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Danny Masterson’s lack of work in the recent years reflects his net worth compared to the rest of the That '70s Show cast.</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ashton-kutcher-and-danny-masterson-became-good-friends-while-filming-that-39-70s-show>Ashton Kutcher And Danny Masterson Became Good Friends While Filming That '70s Show</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/that-70s-show-cast.jpg><p>Danny Masterson and Ashton Kutcher became good friends after being cast on That '70s Show. The two actors would often go out together and even prank each other on set. In fact, at one point during filming, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Masterson bet a 19-year-old Kutcher to French kiss their 14-year-old co-star</a> Mila Kunis.</p><p>Masterson and Kutcher remained close friends after That 70s Show came to an end. However, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Masterson admitted that his relationship with Kutcher changed</a> over time. "Back in the day, we would finish work and start playing Nintendo or go hit the bar.

"They'll run up and down, and sometimes there will be a really dramatic scene being shot, and my daughter will be at Craft service, screaming, 'I want that!'

Chrissie Carnell Bixler, one of Masterson’s victims, publicly denounced the letters by writing, “in my opinion, you’re [Kutcher] just as sick as your ‘mentor’” in an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Instagram Story</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ultimately, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Kutcher and Kunis had to publicly apologize for their letters</a>. “The letters were not written to question the legitimacy of the judicial system or the validity of the jury’s ruling,” Kunis and Kutcher said in a video. “We support victims. We have done this historically through our work and will continue to do so in the future.”</p><p>Moreover, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Kutcher resigned as chair of the board of Thorn</a>, the anti-human trafficking organization he’d co-founded with ex-wife Demi Moore. “Victims of sexual abuse have been historically silenced and the character statement I submitted is yet another painful instance of questioning victims who are brave enough to share their experiences,” Kutcher wrote in a letter obtained by Time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYrKCkpLtut9StmqGdoqh6qrrTnqmvoZWseri106FknZmeo8ZuucCsq56qo6S7brvNZqGapZWoeqS70Z2cp6tdoa61sYysn6ivXZm2pXnNqKtmmZeaerixy6Vm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./becky-sauerbrunn-husband-or-boyfriend-zola-short-are-they-married.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Becky Sauerbrunn Husband Or Boyfriend Zola Short  Are They Married?">&larr;
