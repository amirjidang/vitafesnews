These eight rappers used their success to leverage their way into the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">real estate</a> game. This ranges from current rap stars to rappers who are considered legends in the genre.</p><h2 id=kendrick-lamar>Kendrick Lamar</h2><p>With Kendrick Lamar not releasing a project in five years, real estate could be one of the possible reasons for it. He has been silent for the most part on what he's been up to and this side of him is something even some of the his most loyal fans might not be aware of. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Velvet Ropes</a>, Lamar purchased his current Manhattan Beach home in 2019 for almost $10 million. His family has benefited from his portfolio as well by purchasing a $523,400 home for them in Eastvale, Los Angeles. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Virtual Globetrotting</a> reported that he bought $2.5 million home in Calabasas where his mother and sister live in.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sean-diddy-combs>Sean 'Diddy' Combs</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Realtor.com</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sean Combs </a>extensive real estate portfolio includes in several states. This includes his home state growing up, New York, New Jersey, Los Angeles, Florida and Georgia. One of his many properties is in an area of Miami called Star Island. As the name would suggest, a numerous amount of entertainment and sports stars like Gloria and Emilio Esteban, who Combs bought his property from, Shaquille O’Neal and Alex Rodriguez.</p><h2 id=mike-jones>Mike Jones</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mike Jones</a> is best known for his hits in the 2000s and has kept a low profile musically since 2010. Jones might not be releasing yearly music, but he’s shifted that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">energy to real estate</a>. His company Jones & Carrington Construction focuses on building mansions. In 2017, he said he planned to create a gated community on 23 acres of land with 50 homes. It is unknown how much he has made between music and real estate. Rap is what got him fame and fortune while real estate is what making him expand on his millions.</p><h2 id=t-i>T.I.</h2><p>T.I. with his investments is demonstrating he hasn’t forgot where he came from. He told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">INC </a>reporter Sheila Marikar the reason he started his real estate company, Buy Back the Block, is to recreate his community and help young people not make the same mistakes he did when he was their age. In 2017 alone, T.I. spent over $2 million on six properties in his Center Hill, Atlanta neighborhood. On top of that, he has an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">affordable housing development </a>currently in the works and says the construction should be finished at some point this year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cardi B Recently Dropped $5.85 Million On A New York Home</a></span></p><h2 id=master-p>Master P</h2><p>Master P solidified his legacy in rap as a self made millionaire able to dodge the financial traps of the music industry. Real estate seems to be a logical transition for man <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">full of business savvy</a>. When he and his estranged wife were going through the divorce process, she said he owned<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> 31 properties </a>located Louisiana, California, Tennessee, Texas and Georgia. She stated this back in 2014 and it’s likely the number has increased eight years later.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On a interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a>, Juicy J said his business mentality started at a young age when his father told him to save money for a rainy days. He is aware is main source of income through music might run dry one day and that's what got him to pursue other business ventures like real estate. When he sold his first home he bought, Juicy J got $95,000 more for the house then when he first bought it. This set the trend for his real estate strategy. He said, "I found a bunch of foreclosed homes and foreclosed lands" and "I bought eight acres of land and I just built a house on one of them."</p><h2 id=rick-ross>Rick Ross</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rick Ross told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes </a>, he first learned about real estate through his mother as she would constantly buy properties. Big names in their respective field are associated with some of his properties. In 2008, he bought a home not close to Evander Holyfield's estate for $1 million just to drive by it. In Eddie's Murphy sequel of "Coming to America", Ross's Fayetteville estate was used as a filming area for the movie. Marking a year since it happened, he bought the Florida home of retired NBA star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amare Stoudemire</a> for $3.5 million.</p><h2 id=cardi-b>Cardi B</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Real Deal </a>reported Cardi B has at least four major <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">home purchases</a> in the Dominican Republic, New Jersey and Atlanta where she lives with her husband and Migos member Offset. She used her rising name in the rap scene to help her mother out, buying her a home in New Jersey for $1.5 million. Asides from the mansion she already has in the Dominican Republic, Cardi B has plans to buy more property there and different areas in the Caribbean.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A Peek Inside Adam Levine's Lavish Real Estate Portfolio</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Real Deal</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes </a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">INC</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Curly Nikki</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Realtor.com</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Velvet Ropes</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Virtual Globetrotting</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSFbr7AqaeeqqNixKrAx2agp6uRo7KtxYyer6mdnqi2t7GMq5yapF2awLWt055kqaeiqbOwuMioqmg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./taylor-swift-eras-tour-movie-guide-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A Swifties Guide to Seeing the Eras Tour Movie">&larr;
