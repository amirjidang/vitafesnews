What's interesting is that she rarely starts them. Somehow, other celebrities just feel like attacking her, often for her success. The best example is when Kanye West <a href=#>interrupted her speech at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards</a> after winning Best Female Music Video for You Belong With Me "instead of <strong><a href=#>Beyoncé</a></strong>."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But Ye is not the only male musician who's attacked Swift for her acclaim. At one point, Diplo has also his dislike for the pop star's "unrelatable" music, as well as her figure... Here's a timeline of their feud.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Taylor Swift's 9 Famous Boyfriends: Who Is The Oldest?</a></span></p><h2 id=it-started-when-diplo-body-shamed-taylor-swift-on-twitter>It Started When Diplo Body-Shamed Taylor Swift On Twitter</h2><p>Shortly after the release of Swift's 2014 album 1989, Diplo tweeted: "Someone should make a kickstarter to get taylor swift a booty." Fans immediately defended the Love Story hitmaker. <a href=#>Her then-close friend Lorde</a> also came to her defense. "Should we do something about your tiny p---- while we're at it hm," tweeted the Royals singer. A year later, <a href=#>Swift got involved in another butt-related beef</a> with <strong><a href=#>Nicki Minaj</a></strong>. But this time, she was the one who started it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2015, Minaj took to Twitter to express her disappointment with the MTV Music Awards. The music video for her hit track Anaconda had been snubbed. "If I was a different 'kind' of artist, Anaconda would be nominated for best choreo and vid of the year as well," wrote the Super Bass rapper. "Ellen did her own anaconda video and did the <a href=#>#choreo</a> lol. Remember her doing that kick. Even mtv did a post on the choreo @MTV remember?" She went on to say that it's unfair how "other" female artists get recognized for similar feats.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"U couldn't go on social media w/o seeing ppl doing the cover art, choreo, outfits for Halloween...an impact like that & no VOTY nomination?" she continued. "When the 'other' girls drop a video that breaks records and impacts culture they get that nomination... If your video celebrates women with very slim bodies, you will be nominated for vid of the year." Swift thought it was a dig on her since she was nominated in the category. "@NICKIMINAJ I've done nothing but love & support you." she hit back. "It's unlike you to pit women against each other. Maybe one of the men took your slot.."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Is What Zendaya And Taylor Swift's Relationship Looks Like Today</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Minaj immediately responded. "Huh? U must not be reading my tweets. Didn't say a word about u. I love u just as much. But u should speak on this. @taylorswift13," tweeted the Starships hitmaker. "I'm still confused as to why u just tweeted me when I made it abundantly clear…" The row was soon resolved when Swift realized she read it all wrong. "I thought I was being called out. I missed the point, I misunderstood, then misspoke. I'm sorry, Nicki," she tweeted.</p><h2 id=diplo-dissed-taylor-swift-39-s-music-in-2017>Diplo Dissed Taylor Swift's Music In 2017</h2><p>In 2017, Diplo made some comments about Swift's music in his Rolling Stone interview. "Music is in the hands of the kids. Streaming is literally what kids want to listen to over and over again," the EDM artist told the magazine. "They want to listen to Rockstar and Bodak Yellow. They don't want to listen to, like, Look What You Made Me Do. That music doesn't relate to them at all. I don't think it ever did. They were only given that by radio and marketing budgets. I'm impressed with Post Malone. I can relate to him more than Taylor Swift."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>9 Celebrities Taylor Swift Has Been Friends With The Longest</a></span></p><h2 id=diplo-apologized-to-taylor-swift>Diplo Apologized To Taylor Swift</h2><p>In 2015, Diplo posted a photo of him with Swift at the Grammys. Fans thought they'd finally made up. He also clarified his 2017 statements on a tweet, saying: "Calm down swifties 'all too well' is one of my fav songs." <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In a 2022 interview with Input</a>, Diplo opened up about his unfiltered social media comments and acknowledged his feud with Swift. "I don't take it that seriously. When I first started using social media, it was a big joke for me," he said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"On Twitter, I was an unabashedly crazy person. And I didn't realize that there was power in those words. I would make fun of other artists, and that really came back to hurt me in the end," he continued. "Like I had huge beefs with Lorde and Taylor Swift at the time. And I thought it was so funny, but you know, people hold you accountable for your Twitter in such a strange way. It's not real life. Sarcasm doesn't come through on social media."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Are Taylor Swift And Emma Stone Close Friends?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1lkaOxbrDIqaOoZZaawqV7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./throw-god-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-72477-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Throw God Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography">&larr;
