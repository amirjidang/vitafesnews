A friendship was formed and the two are still as close as ever. Halsey has been an Army for eons and has shown her undying support for BTS. It is no doubt that the feeling is mutual. V and J-Hope have both recorded themselves singing along to Halsey's songs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>BTS and Halsey met at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards and the 'Without Me' singer was taken by the group's charismatic energy. Following <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their 2019 hit 'Boy With Love'</a>, the pair have had nothing but positive things to say about each other. They even gifted each other a microphone and diamond friendship bracelets. Nothing seals a friendship quite like exchanging expenses symbolic items does, well at least for Halsey and her equally talented BFF's.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 BTS Memes Only Real Fans Would Know</a></span></p><h2 id=they-met-at-the-2017-billboard-music-awards>They Met At The 2017 Billboard Music Awards</h2><p>Halsey and BTS have an incredible connection, their friendship is so adorable. Let's hit rewind and go back to how and when they met. The artists met at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards and instantly took to each other. As a collective, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BTS has an infectious disposition</a> and it's easy to see why Halsey connected with the group. She, on the other hand, is passionate and wears her heart on her sleeve. They have been serving serious friendship goals.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When they met back in 2017, Halsey took to Twitter to announce her encounter with the group. The second time they met, she took surprised them with churros before their departure. According to her, she'd heard that the members loved churros and wanted to surprise them. Who doesn't love churros??!</p><p>"Ok I just met @BTS_twt and they are the coolest! WOW."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything There Is To Know About Halsey's Rise To Fame</a></span></p><h2 id=halsey-hang-out-with-bts-in-seoul-during-her-hopeless-fountain-kingdom-world-tour>Halsey Hang Out With BTS In Seoul During Her Hopeless Fountain Kingdom World Tour</h2><p>The pop star credited BTS for inspiring certain aspects of her Hopeless Fountain Kingdom album. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Koreaboo</a>, Halsey told Heat World, "I was watching some of their earlier concept videos and I saw some of the philosophical references they were using, and the colors, and the warmness, and just all of it. It inspired me so much."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It helped me make (Hopeless Fountain Kingdom). I told them that the first time I met them."</p><p>During her Hopeless Fountain Kingdom World Tour, Halsey spent time BTS when she was in South Korea. The pop star later shared posts on both Instagram and Twitter, gushing about the members.</p><p>"You know there was no way I’d come all the way to Seoul without seeing these guys. Can’t wait to see them play Staples Center!!! I’m HELLA proud."</p><p>"We have been friends for almost 2 years! I am so lucky to know them, and they inspire me so much. Your boys are A+."</p><p>Visiting the members of BTS was a wonderful gesture and a true testament to their friendship. Going by the pictures shared to social media, the visit was fun. The friends seemed to enjoy each other's company.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Does BTS Stand For (& 9 Other Things You Didn't Know About The K-Pop Sensation)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=two-years-later-they-collaborated-on-boy-with-love>Two Years Later They Collaborated On Boy With Love</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to CNN</a>, 'Boy With Love' "amassed 74.6 million views in 24 hours, a YouTube spokeswoman confirmed to CNN. The video also took out another milestone, taking under two days to reach 100 million views, the spokeswoman said."</p><p>The collaboration between the pals was a massive hit and the track's music video currently has over 897 million YouTube views. It is a feel-good, upbeat track with lots of great choreography, colorful outfits, and incredible vocals from both collaborators.</p><p>BTS and Halsey had still maintained their friendship over time, Jimin and J-Hope have trolled Halsey to which she's responded humorously on her Twitter account. The trolling comes from her less than stellar dance moves on the 'Boy With Love' music video and her 'I want it' lyrics on the song. It's all in good fun and fans of both artists eat it up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2019 the BTS gifted Halsey with her own shiny microphone, similar to the ones the group uses. While the 'Be Kind' singer, gave the members of the K-pop group pink diamond friendship bracelets. Critics accused Halsey of using BTS for clout, which does not really make sense. The group is K-pop royalty, but the US pop star has also cemented her place in the industry.</p><p>It is not clear whether the friends are still in close contact but we do know is that they still sing each other's praises and some members of BTS have shared videos of themselves singing along to Halsey's music. If that's not proof enough of their incredible bond, we don't know what is. Although, another BTS and Halsey collaboration would be such a treat.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Halsey's Real Name (& 9 Other Things You Didn't Know About Her)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq51dl8G0ecCnm2agkaHApsWMrKuipJxisK270p5krKGemLJuwMeeoKtlk6S5ra3BqKmarJmku267zWaZqLFdrLa1tIylrK9n</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./arnold-schwarzenegger-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-109458-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Arnold Schwarzenegger Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr;
