One of the only tame roles fans have truly seen Black in is the 2006 rom-com The Holiday. However, even Black's character, Miles, had a bit of Black's charisma.</p><p>Despite critics wondering if the rom-com would be a colossal flop, which could have ended Black's career, the film was instead a success and added to Black's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$50 million net worth.</a></p><p>Black might not play the most glamorous characters, but that doesn't mean Black isn't glamorous in real life. Like every other celebrity, he splurges on luxurious things like fancy real estate and nice cars. But Black is like his characters in some ways. He likes his music and he wouldn't be himself if he didn't have a unique collection that fans would have never anticipated.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here's what we know about Black's spending habits.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/hollywood-saved-jack-black-by-canceling-his-worst-movie-ever-deposit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Hollywood Saved Jack Black By Canceling His Worst Movie Ever</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Jack Black was heavily discouraged by critics and fans to avoid a certain film, and he wisely listened.</span><p><strong>Updated March 2024:</strong>Jack Black has been busy as of late promoting the fourth installment of 'Kung Fu Panda', the last of which Black's character, Po will be appearing in. When he's not on the red carpet, he and Tenacious D partner, Kyle Glass released a parody of Britney Spears' 'Baby One More Time', which has been already been liked over 6.8 million times on TikTok.

But <strong>Black and his family do live in the richest part of Hollywood</strong>.</p><p>Their Hollywood Hills home, which they lived in for eight years, was sleek and luxurious. Even though it was built in 1968, it was modern, with concrete floors, glass-walled windows, stainless steel appliances, an industrial sterile living room, a dining room, and a floating staircase.</p><p>According to Lonny, the house went on the market <strong>for $2.8 million</strong>, but the Los Angeles Times says that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Black actually wound up selling the home for $1.5 million</a> after <strong>buying it for $720,000 in 2001</strong>.</p><p>Other homes that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Black has owned over the years include:</a></p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>Los Feliz Mansion</p></td><td><p><strong>Year Purchased:</strong> 2010</p></td><td><p><strong>Purchase Price:</strong> $6 million</p></td><td><p><strong>Year Sold: </strong>Still owns</p></td><td><p><strong>Sale Price: </strong>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Beverly Hills Mansion</p></td><td><p><strong>Year Purchased:</strong> 2005</p></td><td><p><strong>Purchase Price:</strong> $3 million</p></td><td><p><strong>Year Sold:</strong> Still owns</p></td><td><p><strong>Sale Price:</strong> N/A</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The home that Black currently lives in is the Los Feliz mansion.

In fact, Black is a numismatist or someone who studies coins.</p><p>"I love my coins," Black explained on the show. "I do have my favorites. One of them that's really precious to me is the flowing hair penny. It's this gorgeous like 1793, and it's just this beautiful bust of a woman, and her hair is flowing in the breeze, and at the time, people were shocked when they saw it cuz' we have a kind of Puritanical society, 'That's pornographic. You can't show a woman with her hair in the breeze!' And they stopped making that coin and now if you can find that coin, they didn't make very many of them, it's worth like your car! A penny!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Conan showed a picture of the penny and said, "It looks like Roger Daltrey of The Who."</p><p>"And it's kind of representative of the woman that we hold to put her in the Puritanical [gibberish]," Black continued. "And then I got another coin that's a similar theme. The Standing Liberty quarter in 1916. She had an exposed breast, and you can tell how good a quality is; I'm not joking, by the nipple, if the nipple is erect, you know that it's like good quality."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/british-tv-host-vernon-kay-had-surprising-and-harsh-words-to-say-about-jack-black-front-back-_-deposit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>A British TV Host Slammed His Experience With Jack Black, Tarnishing His Positive Reputation</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>British TV host Vernon Kay has been brutally honest about his feelings towards Jack Black, here's why he can't stand the iconic actor.</span><p>They showed that coin too.

Black pulled a joke and said in 1828; they put out a coin of a standing Lincoln with no pants on, which Conan's fans enjoyed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jack Black continues to surprise us every day.
