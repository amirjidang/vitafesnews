Of course, her biggest role was as Monica Geller on Friends. But she is also loved in the Scream franchise as nosy journalist, fan-favorite, and later hero Gale Weathers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The movies are iconic amongst horror movie fans, so when Scream 5 came out in early 2022, it put the spotlight back on the cast. Cox revealed to fans what her experience was like filming all the movies and had some surprising things to say.</p><h2 id=the-legacy-of-courteney-cox>The Legacy Of Courteney Cox</h2><p>Courteney Cox's initial rise to fame happened because of Friends. It placed her directly in the spotlight. But she did star in countless other films and shows prior to the sitcom. One of the major roles was, of course, fan-favorite Gale Weathers. The first Scream movie premiered in 1996 and was a huge hit. Four movies followed after, the newest one premiering in 2022. Fans believe the two roles as Monica Geller and Gale Weathers are what made Courteney Cox a critically acclaimed actress.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's How Neve Campbell Made Millions From 'Scream'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Courteney Cox actually married her Scream co-star, David Arquette, who played Dwight "Dewey" Riley. <a href=#>The newest 'Scream' movie was the first one for them filming not married</a>. Scream became one of the highest-grossing horror franchises of all time and fans were thrilled to see it back and meet their favorite characters again.</p><p>Cox has gone on to star in countless television shows and movies. In 2009, she was the main star of an ABC comedy series, Cougar Town, a show about a 40-year-old mom who is nearly single and looking for more experiences in her life. This show also gave her the opportunity to showcase her directing skills and make her directorial debut for season three. Fans have seen Cox in multiple other roles after Cougar Town as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=courteney-cox-opens-up-about-filming-39-scream-39-movies>Courteney Cox Opens Up About Filming 'Scream' Movies</h2><p>Gale Weathers is a lovable character because of her development through the films. She starts out as an 'enemy' but later on becomes a loving friend to the main character, Sidney Prescott (saving her more than once). So what did Courteney have to say about her time on Scream?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Scream' Confirms This Meta Easter Egg In New Movie</a></span></p><p>She says it was pretty hard at times. But not because of any problems with cast-mates. In fact, Cox and Neve Campbell revealed that they have a close bond on and off the screen. Filming Scream was harder to film for other reasons, including the horror aspect of it, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the main reasons being the stunts the horror movie entailed</a>.</p><p>She also revealed that she did all of her own stunts, noting that the stunts at the finale of the movies are the roughest. She went on to reveal that when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she was younger, it was no big deal</a> but on the newest movie she definitely paid for it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The cast refers to the 42-minute-long ending party scene of the first film as the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"longest night in horror history."</a> It took twenty-one full days to complete filming it. The scene takes place at Stu's (who is one of the killers) house and is filled with action, gore, and jump scares.</p><p>No wonder it took a lot of effort to make it. Courteney reassured fans that although it was difficult to film, the love she has for the franchise and Gale Weathers in still abundant.</p><h2 id=where-is-courtney-cox-now>Where is Courtney Cox Now?</h2><p>Courteney Cox never faded from fame. But with the recent Scream and Friends: The Reunion, she was for sure back in the same spotlight she was in during the '90s.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Courtney Cox Found Filming This 'Friends' Scene A Nightmare</a></span></p><p>Besides revealing details about her time on Scream, she also revealed things about her time on Friends that fans did not know. She revealed she doesn't remember filming Friends at all; <a href=#>Cox blames that on bad memory</a>. Amongst all the Scream and Friends reunion, Cox stars in a new comedy/horror series on Starz. It is titled Shining Vale. She said <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"she loves to be scared and she loves to laugh".</a> So this series is perfect for her. It is almost like it combines her two major roles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Currently, Cox is in a relationship with Snow Patrol band member, Johnny McDaid. The two have been together since 2013, and were even briefly engaged in 2014. After breaking off the engagement, they still stayed together as a couple to this day. Apart from developments in her personal life, Cox is also set to be an executive producer and star in a documentary series called Last Chance U, a Spectrum original adaptation.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>15 Facts About Courteney Cox That Friends Fans Would Be Surprised To Learn</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdmLy2vtOepZ6xXZi8uXnLoqKeZZKatq%2BzjKKlZquTp7KiuY4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-does-jeff-probst-do-when-the-survivor-cameras-arent-rolling.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Does Jeff Probst Do When The 'Survivor' Cameras Arent Rolling?">&larr;
