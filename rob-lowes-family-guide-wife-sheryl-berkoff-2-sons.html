The experience had nothing but a positive influence on their relationship, as they fell in love and tied the knot the following year.</p><p>Around the time of their 1991 nuptials, Rob began his recovery journey after struggling with substance abuse for several years. He later credited Berkoff for <a href=#>helping him make it through</a> the difficult process. “Listen, she may have saved my life, really,” he told <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> in May 2021.</p><p>The <a href=#>Parks and Recreation</a> alum continued: “I mean, she met me when I was at the end of my <a href=#>’80s run of wild boy craziness</a> and she was worth changing my life for. And so I am really lucky that that happened to me. Maybe I had changed it on my own, maybe, but it’s a big maybe. And just when I met her, I knew that if I could not make it with her, I definitely could not make it work with anyone else.”</p><p>Rob and Berkoff became parents in 1993 with the birth of their son <strong><a href=#>Matthew</a></strong>. Two years later, they became a family of four with the addition of their son <strong><a href=#>John</a></strong> in 1995.</p><p>The Love Life author’s close-knit <a href=#>relationship with his kids</a> is something he said is his proudest accomplishment as a parent. “Now that they’re older, they don’t need so much discipline,” Rob explained in an April 2019 interview with <a href=#>Fatherly</a>. “I can lean into the friendship. I love having that time with them, talking about work, about jobs, career advancement and strategizing and going out golfing or going to a Dodgers game. It’s the best relationship I could hope for.</p><p>When it comes to what advice the <a href=#>St. Elmo’s Fire</a> star gave his kids about pursuing their own careers, he said, “Find a job you love and you’ll never work a day in your life.”</p><p>It just so happens that Rob’s kids <a href=#>share his passion for entertainment</a>, as well as his curiosity about the unknown. The three teamed up to investigate some of the country’s most mysterious legends and stories on the 2017 series <a href=#>The Lowe Files</a>.</p><p>John has built up an acting career of his own, starring alongside Rob in projects such as <a href=#>The Grinder</a> and Holiday in the Wild. In 2023, John and Rob co-created the <a href=#>Netflix</a> comedy Unstable, on which they play <a href=#>father-son duo</a> Jackson and Ellis, respectively. The series follows the two as they work to rekindle their strained relationship while saving Ellis’ biotech company.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“This show is about a son who wants to get out of his father’s shadow, and I am literally a son who <a href=#>wants to get out of my father’s shadow</a>,” John said in a March 2023 interview with <a href=#>Variety</a>. “I have adopted a new perspective on that, which is, when you’re lost in the forest, sometimes the only way to get out is to go deeper into the forest.”</p><p>Scroll below to meet Rob’s famous family:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkv7CujKWmsJ2jYrOiucilsGafpZ6xpnnWop2eZaOdsrPFy2aZnqqbpLOneZFmqqimo2Q%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./roxy-horner-height-weight-net-worth-age-wiki-who-instagram-biography-31024-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Roxy Horner Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Who, Instagram, Biography">&larr;
