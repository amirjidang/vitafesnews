During the reunion, fans got excited to learn that <strong><a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>David Schwimmer</a></strong> shared more feelings off-camera, that extended away from <strong><a href=#>Friends</a></strong>. However, the timing was never right between the two.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the following, we're going to take a closer look at their chemistry off-camera, and what producer Kevin S. Bright had to say about their relationship. We're also going to take a closer look at Jennifer Aniston's comments pertaining to her first kiss with David Schwimmer. Both Kelly Ripa and Ryan Seacrest assumed it was an awkward experience for the actress, but her response had both of them stunned, and laughing.</p><p>Let's take a look back at the interview moment, and so much more between Ross and Rachel.</p><h2 id=friends-producer-kevin-s-bright-was-suspicious-that-there-was-something-more-between-jennifer-aniston-and-david-schwimmer>Friends Producer Kevin S.

Fans had a blast with this behind the scenes reveal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Schwimmer admitted that although the feelings were mutual for one another, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the timing was never on their side.</a></p><p>“I think at some point we were both crushing hard on each other, but it was like two ships passing because one of us was always in a relationship, and we never crossed that boundary,” he clarified. “We respected that."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Matt LeBlanc Turned Down Jennifer Aniston's Wedding Invite With Brad Pitt, And His Friends Co-Star Wasn't Pleased</a></span></p><p>Producer Kevin S. Bright would also reveal that just by seeing the two together behind the scenes, it was evident that something more was there.</p><p>“It was a very hot topic on the set because the electricity between them in the scenes was like, ‘Oh, my God, they can’t be acting that, there’s got to be something!’ Everybody was suspicious that something was going on."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“People made up their own rumors at a certain point. But we all thought something might have been going on because they were just so good together. We were so invested in Ross and Rachel, like the rest of you. There was something about them. But like the show, in a certain way, you had to wait a long time and then it never happened. The happy ending is in the show.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Friends Had To Ban A Scene Featuring Courteney Cox And Matthew Perry, But Fans Think It Was Better Than What Aired Instead</a></span></p><p>The two stars ended up sharing their first ever kiss on-screen.

Aniston readied herself for the kiss, as the two stars couldn't believe their first embrace was about to take place on national television.</p><h2 id=check-out-other-actors-favorite-on-screen-kisses>Check Out Other Actors Favorite On-Screen Kisses</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong><strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I remember saying one time to David, ‘It’s gonna be such a bummer if the first time you and I actually kiss is going to be on national television,’” she said during the special. “Sure enough, the first time we kissed was in that coffee shop. We just channeled all of our adoration and love for each other into Ross and Rachel.”</p><p>Given her circumstances, Kelly Ripa and Ryan Seacrest assumed the moment was an awkward one for Aniston. But instead, she gave a response that caught the two off-guard. "It was quite enjoyable actually," Aniston answered Ripa.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Matthew Perry's Wedding Scene With Courteney Cox On Friends Took A Dark Turn Behind The Scenes</a></span></p><p>It was truly yet another moment that made fans fall in love with Ross and Rachel that much more.</p><h2 id=jennifer-aniston-admitted-reuniting-with-the-friends-cast-was-a-lot-harder-than-she-expected>Jennifer Aniston Admitted Reuniting With The Friends Cast Was A Lot Harder Than She Expected</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/jennifer-aniston-looking-upset.jpg><p>Given her success on the series, most fans assumed that Aniston and the others were ecstatic about returning to the set of Friends all those years later. However, the actress revealed that wasn't necessarily the case. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Aniston felt lots of different emotions</a>, and it wasn't easy for her to relive moment from the past.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“It was a sucker punch,” she said. “No one really expected what we were gonna feel. Because in your mind you’re like, Ooh, time travel! That sounds really cool! And then you’re there and you’re like, Oh, that’s really intense — because so much has happened since.”</p><p>Aniston continues, “In your mind, you think, ‘Oh, this will be really fun to time travel,’” she said to Lowe. “It turns out… it’s kind of hard to time travel.”</p><p>"It’s nostalgic in a way that’s kind of also a little melancholy, you know, ‘cause a lot has changed. We have all gone down different roads...Some easy and some not-so easy, for each of us.”</p><p>From a fan perspective, the reunion was quite the blast and one most wouldn't mind seeing on a yearly basis. Though sadly, it remains to be seen if there will ever be another.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqaenrOmvoyapaKrpKS7br%2FTrqWnnZRiuKa4y7Jkq6GglnqiusNmqbKZnmLApq3Cq5ysrF2Wr7DB02aioqujnruoecOaraKcXaiwqcPIpqSeql2bvLN506GcZp6Zp8C1edOipJ5ln6N6p77InqWdq18%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./why-jerry-seinfeld-hates-bobcat-goldthwait-feud-comedy.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jerry Seinfeld Can't Stand This Comedy Legend And Fans Kind Of Understand Why">&larr;
