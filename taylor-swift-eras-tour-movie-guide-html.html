This is Taylor Swift’s first worldwide theatrical release — <a href=#>Miss Americana was only shown in select theaters</a> for a limited time before hitting Netflix — and fans have already embraced the concert film almost as much as the sold-out tour itself. It broke presale records held by <a href=#>Star Wars</a> and Spider-Man, and movie theaters<strong> </strong>are<strong> </strong>anticipating a level of<strong> </strong>excitement similar to a Marvel movie.<strong> </strong>But Swifties are stuck in a <a href=#>lavender haze</a> of questions, trying to figure out if they can take the souvenir cups home or sing at the top of their lungs in a packed theater. Put on your sparkly boots and remember <a href=#>heartbreak is supposed to feel good</a> in a place like this, as we break down everything you need to know about seeing the Eras Tour movie.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clnkft0b4000h3b70lvw86bby@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>How do I get a ticket if I haven’t already?</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnkftmvb000o3b704dfvhpnj@published data-word-count=47>While most opening night screenings are probably sold out, there are a few screenings with available tickets if you don’t mind sitting in the front row. Every AMC theater has at least four screenings per day during opening weekend, and most other theater chains are following suit.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnknvb1a000w3b80zot3drd2@published data-word-count=58>If you can’t make it opening weekend, AMC, Alamo Drafthouse, and Cinemark have tickets on sale through November 5 — Regal has showings until November 9 in some areas. This gives you a chance to rewatch the concert over and over again. However, <a href=#>screenings</a> are only shown Thursday to Sunday to mimic the feeling of the in-person concert.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clnjqczv6001b3b80kfn6i4k4@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Okay, I have my tickets. Can I dance and sing?</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnjqfka1002z3b80bbrovjob@published data-word-count=124>Yes! As long as it is not disrupting other Swifties’ enjoyment of the show. Alamo Drafthouse is encouraging fans to have fun while watching the movie. We’d recommend some arm dancing whilst sitting comfortably in your seat, as most theaters have rules about blocking emergency walkways or the view from other patrons. AMC specifically <a href=#>states</a>, “We encourage dancing and singing throughout this concert film event, but please do not dance on our seats or block other guests from viewing, safely walking or exiting the auditorium.” And while some metalheads might disagree, singing does not equal screaming. The show is two hours and 45 minutes, not including trailers, and you’ll need to preserve it for the full 10 minutes of “All Too Well (Taylor’s Version).”</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clnjqd1zd001k3b80ct11mclm@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>What about taking photos?</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnjqfnmq003g3b80464n2c8d@published data-word-count=42>You can take photos with your friends and their friendship bracelets before the show starts, but once Tay is on the screen, the phone goes away. The same rules apply during regular theater screenings. <a href=#>You wouldn’t steal a getaway car</a>, would you?</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clnjqd3xp001u3b8084x4ugsl@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>What’s the deal with merch?</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnjqfr2w003z3b80mryut6n8@published data-word-count=100>Most theater chains all have some sort of Eras-themed soda cup and popcorn bucket. The material and/or color of the items may change depending on the theater, but the design is essentially the same. Regal has a pretty good deal for $19.89 (cute!). Fans who were scarred by <a href=#>the blue-crewneck saga</a> and <a href=#>the hours-long merch queue</a> at concerts may try to line up early to make sure they get their items, which isn’t a bad idea. There are free mini movie posters at select theaters like <a href=#>AMC</a>, Regal, and <a href=#>Cinemark</a> for ticket holders, a.k.a. another reason to get there early.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Regal (@regalmovies)</a></p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by AMC Theatres (@amctheatres)</a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnjr3xjd009h3b80wvvi4dx7@published data-word-count=52>There is one theater that seems to have pulled out all the stops for merch, and it’s surprisingly not AMC, especially since it’s the one directly partnering with Swift for the movie.

There might be a line to get your free mini poster and buy collectible cups and popcorn buckets, so it’d be a good idea to<strong> </strong>arrive in advance. After you’ve gathered everything you need for the show, you can make new friends — you’ll need as many as possible to try to decipher whatever Easter egg Swift will probably sneak into the movie.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clnkfuypf000u3b703stqlgqk@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>It’s nearly three hours long — when can I safely go to the bathroom?</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnkfwmmd001e3b70rfahblsy@published data-word-count=76>It depends on what your favorite era is, but a good halfway mark is sometime during the Red era. The beginning of the era (right after “Enchanted”) includes a small dance number that’s a few minutes long, and if you time it right after Swift ends the Speak Now portion, you should make it back during the middle of “22.” You could also leave during “All Too Well (Ten Minute Version),” technically only missing one song.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clntou9sa000f3b7h6bj8xkgm@published data-word-count=23>If you need a break earlier (or just want to avoid crying in front of people), step out during “marjorie” or “champagne problems.”</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clntov6f2000j3b7ho8yn00bl@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Were songs cut from the film?</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clntovygw000o3b7hr3otv712@published data-word-count=106>Sorry, we’re about to break a perfectly good heart. While it was previously confirmed that no songs would be cut from the Eras Tour film, a few ended up on the chopping block. Lover’s “The Archer,” folklore’s “cardigan,” 1989’s “Wildest Dreams,” evermore’s “no body no crime” featuring HAIM, and Speak Now’s “Long Live” (though the latter’s studio version was included in the end credits). The “seven” interlude in the folklore section was also removed from the theatrical version. But who’s to say Miss Swift won’t release an extended version on streaming in the future? Swifties know that “Maroon” was filmed and they want the high-definition version!</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clnjqe3xe002h3b800tygbqg5@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Will there be friendship bracelets?</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnjqfxsk00573b80tuzee4zm@published data-word-count=127>Duh. You won’t be on your own kid. For almost a year, Swifties have been making frequent trips to the craft store; Michaels saw a 300 percent increase in sales from jewelry-making supplies in cities where the Eras Tour stops were held. There are a few easy ways to get your bracelets ready for trading. The first is to have one arm as your “trading” arm, filled with bracelets you’ve made to trade with others or ones you’re retrading, and have the other arm to display the ones you’re keeping. Makes it easy to separate your own collection from the ones you plan to switch out. The second is to hold your trading bracelets on an old shower or carabiner ring, separating them by theme or album.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnjqg8ci006n3b8057lg6yw2@published data-word-count=94>If you’re stuck trying to figure out movie-related phrases for your bracelets, here are a few to get you started: “<a href=#>If This Was a Movie</a>,” “<a href=#>I can AMC you</a>,” “<a href=#>flashback in a film reel,</a>” “<a href=#>I Alamo-st Do</a>,” or —&nbsp;if you’re feeling a little unhinged — “<a href=#>The Lorax</a>.” Simpler ones like “In my movies era,” or “Eras Tour,” or your favorite Swift songs would totally work too. However, if you don’t want to risk burning yourself with a <a href=#>hot-glue gun</a>, <a href=#>AMC</a> and Alamo Drafthouse have both been rumored to have some bracelets of their own.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clnjqei3j002q3b807umwx7rb@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Anything else I should expect?</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnjqg0md005w3b80oypf55au@published data-word-count=11>A lot of singing, some crying, and definitely some hand hearts.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clntoxrlq000t3b7h02nudbs0@published data-word-count=11>This post has been updated since the release of the film.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clmy5b83000000pfblm18r6w3@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Taylor Swift, Travis Kelce: Complete Dating Rumor Timeline</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clm0w2ey800000pcuvsqb9eho@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Here Come the Eras Tour Concert Film Box Office</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cllz5h9rs004s0ia19hykiw12@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Taylor Swift Adds a Theater Near You to Eras Tour Stops</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>A Swiftie’s Guide to Seeing the Eras Tour Movie</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpbGdhZXy1rdilpqtlo6y2p8CMnqmaq12pvLa%2BjKamr6GVYrS2tcOeZaGsnaE%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./a-walk-through-the-true-personality-of-jocelyn-flores-and-how-she-died.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A Walk Through The True Personality of Jocelyn Flores and How She Died">&larr;
