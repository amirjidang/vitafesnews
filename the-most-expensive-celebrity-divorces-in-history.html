For celebrities, divorce regularly entails massive settlements and equally large fights over the wealth these couples accumulated together.</p><p>Over the years, many <a href=#>celebrity couples have gotten together</a> and have broken up, even the seemingly picture perfect ones. Being a celebrity means having most of your life exposed to the public, the internet, and the world in general.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, most high profile celebrity relationships face an unrelenting level of scrutiny, placing yet another a stressor on the couple. Join us in this dive into the most expensive celebrity divorces in history – this list is based mostly on approximate figures of the proceedings and information disclosed to the public, whereas relevant information is occasionally redacted from the record for privacy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single><strong>Related:<a href=#>Kanye West Fears Kim Kardashian Is Spoiling Their Kids Post-Divorce, Though She Swore She Wouldn’t</a></strong></span></p><h2 id=melinda-and-bill-gates-76-billion-2021><span class=item-num>1 </span><span><strong>Melinda And Bill Gates: $76 Billion (2021)</strong></span></h2><p>A well known co-founder of the huge tech firm Microsoft, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bill Gates</a> rose to become extremely rich – and remains among the richest people in the world (despite no longer claiming the top spot).</p><p>The couple was together for about 27 years, marrying in 1994 and later separating in 2021. As the couple called the state of Washington (which is a community state) home, Melinda Gates was entitled to a fifty-fifty split of all the wealth the two had created, as there was no evidence of any prenuptial agreement.</p><p>Additionally, Melinda had played a significant role in building the Gates' fortune.

Having studied at Princeton, MacKenzie earned her own BSC degree in English – and was significant as not only Jeff's wife, but also played a significant role as a business partner and co-founder of Amazon.</p><p>This, coupled with the absence of an existing prenuptial agreement, Scott was awarded a settlement of about $38.3 billion (approximately, as the specific terms are to a degree kept out of the public record). It is noteworthy that MacKenzie donated a significant part of her payout to various charities and organizations to support people living poverty, racial justice, and education.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kim-kardashian-and-kanye-west-2-1-billion-2022><span class=item-num>3 </span><span><strong>Kim Kardashian And Kanye West: $2.1 Billion (2022)</strong></span></h2><p>Probably the most recent (and the most present in the media by far) divorce on the list, <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a> and <a href=#>Kanye West</a> "broke the internet" by getting together in 2014, and again with their divorce in 2022. The couple had four kids together; Kim was awarded a settlement of about $2.1 billion, and a monthly settlement of about $200,000 for each of the four kids they have together.</p><p>Kim is known for her various luxury lifestyle brands and entrepreneurship ventures in the beauty, fashion and lifestyle industry.
