Refusing to let that dream go, the Oscar-nominated actor has maintained a steady side-gig of playing in various groups and guesting on friends’ albums, often showing up at concerts to play a few songs. Viewers of the 2016 Grammys got to see just how seriously Depp takes his music, as he performed a Motörhead cover and an original song with his new band, Hollywood Vampires, which features Alice Cooper, Aerosmith’s Joe Perry, and two members of Guns N’ Roses.
