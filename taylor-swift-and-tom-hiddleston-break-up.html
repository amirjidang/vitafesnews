The singer and Tom met at New York's star-studded Met Gala in 2016. The pair were filmed dancing at the party. At that time, Taylor Swift had just broken up with the acclaimed DJ Calvin Harris. Two weeks after the breakup, she was photographed kissing Hiddleston on a beach. However, Tom made the relationship public so fast that the media accused him of using the You Belong With Me singer to gain fame. Hiddleston defended by saying, "The truth is Taylor and I are together. We're very happy. Thanks for asking. That's the truth. Not a publicity stunt."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But the question remained: Was he really using her for fame? Some people pointed out that Hiddleston's relationship might have cost him the role of James Bond since the franchise likes to cast low-profile men like Daniel Craig, who keeps his life private. It was said that the franchise was interested in Tom until he got into a relationship with Taylor. And this was just the start of Tom's nightmare. The couple broke up after three months of dating. Here are all the reasons why Taylor Swift and Tom Hiddleston were never meant to be.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-felt-uncomfortable-with-tom-hiddleston-s-desire-to-make-their-relationship-public><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Taylor Swift Felt 'Uncomfortable' With Tom Hiddleston's Desire To Make Their Relationship Public</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmopolitan</a>, a source from Daily Mail revealed that their separation stems from Tom asking Taylor to be his date to the Emmys. However, Taylor didn't feel comfortable making their relationship public so soon. The insider added, "Tom's need for their relationship to be so public so quickly makes her uncomfortable. She tried to be OK with it in the beginning but fears he is in love with the idea of her and not falling in love with her for the right reasons." Tom allegedly wanted their relationship to be public, which was previously bashed for being "a publicity stunt." On the other hand, Taylor reportedly wanted to keep her private life private, so the idea of walking a red carpet together as a couple and as the first boyfriend she's ever walked a carpet with was unsettling to her.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jimmy Fallon Broke Down In Tears After Taylor Swift Did This On The 'Tonight Show'</a></span></p><h2 id=taylor-swift-didn-t-make-the-first-move-in-her-relationship-with-tom-hiddleston><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Taylor Swift Didn't Make The First Move In Her Relationship With Tom Hiddleston</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>An insider revealed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">US Weekly</a> that Taylor Swift was fresh off her breakup with Calvin Harris when Tom started reaching out. "He really courted her. He liked her and saw an opportunity when she was suddenly single, and he went for it." Even though the Bad Blood singer was newly single, the insider said that Taylor wouldn't let her breakup get in the way of her having fun. At that time, the insider added, "She's single, so of course, if a cute guy reaches out who she likes, she would talk to him. There really isn't a better way to get over a breakup!"</p><h2 id=the-media-accused-tom-hiddleston-of-using-taylor-swift-for-fame><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>The Media Accused Tom Hiddleston Of Using Taylor Swift For Fame</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Tom Hiddleston started dating Taylor Swift in 2016, he gained a lot of attention. Although he wasn't new to Hollywood, he was new to superstardom. At that time, the actor participated in many indie movies but wasn't yet a household name. Although he was already known for his role as Loki, Tom wasn't as famous as Taylor Swift. Some fans think Tom used Taylor only to toss her to the side once he became more famous.</p><h2 id=tom-hiddleston-s-busy-filming-schedule-got-in-the-way-of-his-romance-with-taylor-swift><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Tom Hiddleston's Busy Filming Schedule Got In The Way Of His Romance With Taylor Swift</span></h2><p>Taylor Swift and Tom Hiddleston's relationship reached its first conflict when the actor got busy shooting for Thor: Ragnarok. At that time, a source revealed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a> that they weren't spending as much time together, saying, "There was so much going on, so it was hard making their schedules work, and they were upset they couldn't see each other." It was only three months into their relationship, and the couple broke up. The reason was that they had a major argument over their long-distance relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Drake's New IG Post Suggests He's Collaborating With Taylor Swift</a></span></p><h2 id=did-taylor-swift-divert-attention-from-her-kanye-west-drama-onto-tom><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Did Taylor Swift Divert Attention From Her Kanye West Drama Onto Tom?</span></h2><p>Taylor Swift and Tom Hiddleston were spotted kissing for the very first time when <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a>'s GQ interview dropped in which she called out Taylor for being a liar. As many fans know, Taylor's public reputation decreased when <a href=#>Kanye West</a> released a song regarding her named Famous. <a href=#>In the song, Kanye dissed Taylor</a>. The Bad Blood singer said that she didn't give permission to include a rude lyric about her in the rapper's song. But some people thought she turned out to be a liar when Kim Kardashian leaked a conversation between Taylor and Kanye. The convo clearly showed that the rapper had contacted Taylor regarding the song. However, Kim's GQ interview went almost unnoticed because the news of Taylor's new boyfriend gained more attention.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tom-hiddleston-seemed-relieved-after-his-breakup-with-taylor-swift><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Tom Hiddleston Seemed Relieved After His Breakup With Taylor Swift</span></h2><p>Even though they broke up for a reason being the long-distance, it was clear Hiddleston was done with <a href=#>all the media drama related to Taylor</a>. Also, Taylor had hurried into the relationship since she didn't even wait a month after breaking up with Calvin Harris. They got together way too fast. So, did Hiddleston use Taylor Swift for fame, or it's the other way around? Because as things stand, some people think that Taylor used Hiddleston to move on from her breakup with the DJ. Either way, the truth is that Taylor Swift and Tom Hiddleston were never meant to be.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Taylor Swift Walked Off And Gave The Phone To Her Publicist During This Radio Interview</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1lkaOxbsDOpmShoZSZuaa%2F06ilZpqimq6sedSpZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./quinta-brunson-abbott-elementary-surprise-reunion-1234646623.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Quinta Brunson Surprised By Teacher Who Inspired 'Abbott Elementary'">&larr;
