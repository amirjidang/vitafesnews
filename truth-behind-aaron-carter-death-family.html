As the youngest brother to Nick Carter, who had already garnered fame and success from the Backstreet Boys, Aaron's talent and good looks got him noticed by record executives immediately. As such, Aaron's <strong><a href=#>music</a></strong> began hitting and climbing the charts when he was just 10 years old.</p><p>By the time Aaron was 13 years old, he had several multi-platinum albums under his belt. However, Aaron also became an accomplished actor, making appearances in multiple popular television series and films. He even appeared on Broadway in Seussical and The Fantastiks. All of this success led to multiple awards and Aaron even became the youngest singer to have four consecutive Top 10 singles in the UK. Aaron had accomplished a massive amount at a young age, and he had the multimillion fortune to prove it. Sadly, <a href=#>Aaron ultimately lost his fortune</a> and his health.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">amount of success that Aaron achieved was too much, too soon</a>. With access to anything he wanted, exacerbated by a "toxic family dynamic" and Aaron's diagnosis of "schizophrenia and multiple personality disorder," Aaron began to spiral.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/aaron-carter-s-siblings-are-picking-up-the-pieces-of-their-lives-after-his-death-front-deposit-back-the-petty-show_youtube.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Aaron Carter's Siblings Are Picking Up The Pieces Of Their Lives After His Death">Aaron Carter's Siblings Are Picking Up The Pieces Of Their Lives After His Death</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Despite enduring challenging family tragedies, Aaron Carter's siblings are dedicated to preserving his legacy to the best of their abilities.</p><p>Things got worse when Aaron's sister, Leslie, died from an overdose, and a few years later, his father died of a heart attack. This left his mom to turn to, whom Aaron had blamed for stealing his fortune over the years. With the pressures of his career and the deaths in his family, Aaron turned to huffing and opioids to cope. <a href=#>The drug use led to massive scandals that Aaron found himself embroiled in</a>. The drugs and huffing would also ultimately lead to his death.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The tragic truth about Aaron Carter's passing and what his family did immediately after, falls in line with what Aaron had accused them of for so many years. The truth was that even before a proper investigation was done, Aaron's family was trying to profit off of him and ultimately succeeded in doing so, though not to the extent they had hoped to.</p><h2 id=the-tragic-truth-about-aaron-carter-39-s-passing>The Tragic Truth About Aaron Carter's Passing</h2><h3 id=even-after-his-death-people-still-wanted-to-exploit-aaron-carter>Even after his death, people still wanted to exploit Aaron Carter</h3><p>In November 2022, reports broke that Aaron had passed away at the age of 34 years old. The singer was found in his Lancaster, California home in the morning by his housekeeper. At the time, the initial cause of death was drowning, which many began to speculate was a result of self harm.</p><p>But when those close to Aaron came forward and said that he had plans to go to the studio to lay tracks to new music and the fact that he was in the process of selling his home for a fresh start with his fianc√©e, <a href=#>Melanie Martin, who Aaron's family did not like</a>, and his then-one-year-old son, Prince, self harm seemed unlikely.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/instar52147485.jpg><p>Ultimately, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the autopsy report shed more light on Aaron's situation</a> when it was discovered that generic Xanax and inhaling difluoroethane "incapacitated" Aaron, leading to his eventual drowning. Despite Aaron's claims of being clean and sober, he unfortunately was not and that was what led to his demise.</p><p>What was sobering about the situation, however, was how some of Aaron's family behaved in the wake of his death. Instead of letting the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department and the Coroner's Office finish their investigations, <strong>Aaron's mother, Jane Schneck, released pictures of the overdose scene</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jane claimed this was because she wanted to get to the bottom of what really happened to Aaron. However, critics question what the real reason was that Jane posted the photos and if her intentions were as pure as she wanted the public to believe.</p><h2 id=aaron-carter-39-s-mom-released-photos-of-the-overdose-scene>Aaron Carter's Mom Released Photos Of The Overdose Scene</h2><h3 id=jane-schneck-released-several-photos-from-the-overdose-scene-before-investigations-into-aaron-carter-39-s-death-had-concluded>Jane Schneck released several photos from the overdose scene before investigations into Aaron Carter's death had concluded</h3><p>In the months after Aaron's death, answers still needed to be answered regarding what the cause of death was. But before the results were conclusive, or a report could be made public, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jane took to social media and released photos of the overdose scene</a>. Those who saw them were shocked, which led to questions as to why Aaron's mother released them.</p><p>"Still trying to get a real investigation for the death of my son Aaron Carter," Jane wrote in a Facebook post. "I want to share these death scene photos with you all because the coroner wrote it off as an accidental drug overdose."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Aaron-Carter-and-Jane-Carter.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jane went on to say, "They never investigated it as a possible crime scene because of his addiction past."</p><p>"Look at the photos They were not taken by the police But they allowed people to go in and out," Jane alleged of the death scene, "although a lot of potential homicide information was there for years Aaron had a lot of death threats and many many people who were making his life miserable."</p><p>Despite Jane releasing these photos to get to the bottom of the investigation, when she did so, the investigation was not concluded. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This left critics wondering why she released the photos in the first place</a>.</p><p>"Nothing about these pictures points to foul play, so releasing them was unnecessary," one critic wrote. "This is exploitative, just let him rest in peace."</p><p>A second critic stated, "Money and attention off the back of her dead child, that‚Äôs what she‚Äôs going for."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/did-aaron-carter-s-death-tear-nick-carter-further-away-from-his-siblings-or-bring-them-closer-together_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Did Aaron Carter's Death Tear Nick Carter Further Away From His Siblings Or Bring Them Closer Together?">Did Aaron Carter's Death Tear Nick Carter Further Away From His Siblings Or Bring Them Closer Together?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Nick Carter and his siblings are still grieving the loss of Aaron Carter; here's whether it's brought them closer or caused internal feuds.</p><p>"Disgusting to exploit her son‚Äôs tragedy even after death," a third critic said.</p><p>While exposing the photos of the death scene was bad enough, there were even those outside of the family who were trying to exploit Aaron in his death. One of which was a publisher who tried to release Aaron's autobiography just weeks after he passed. The publisher claimed Aaron wanted the book released, while those close to him stated Aaron wanted "nothing to do" with the book being published.</p><h2 id=aaron-carter-39-s-autobiography-was-set-to-be-released-against-his-wishes>Aaron Carter's Autobiography Was Set To Be Released Against His Wishes</h2><h3 id=aaron-carter-39-s-autobiography-was-set-to-be-published-less-than-two-weeks-after-his-death>Aaron Carter's autobiography was set to be published less than two weeks after his death</h3><p>Aaron passed away on November 5, 2022. While those who cared about Aaron were still trying to wrap their heads around the fact that he was gone, a publisher decided to capitalize on his death and publish his unfinished autobiography. The launch received massive backlash from those close to Aaron and those in the entertainment industry as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aaron Carter: An Incomplete Story of an Incomplete Life was slated to be released on November 15. According to Ballast Books, the publishing house that was set to release the autobiography, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Aaron wanted to publish the book</a> "with all its beauty and rawness." They were moving to get the book on shelves after Aaron's death, so fans could get an insight into Aaron's thoughts and feelings. However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">those close to Aaron said the opposite was true</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/instar50498238-1.jpg><p>"Aaron, in the midst of [working on the book], said, ‚ÄòI want nothing to do with this‚Äô and stopped, so the fact that the publisher is saying it‚Äôs green-lit, it‚Äôs not," Aaron's publicist explained.

In her statement, Hillary said, "It‚Äôs really sad that within a week of Aaron‚Äôs death, there‚Äôs a publisher that seems to be recklessly pushing a book out to capitalize on this tragedy without taking appropriate time or care to fact-check the validity of his work."</p><p>Hillary went on to say, "To water down Aaron‚Äôs life story to what seems to be unverified click-bait for profit is disgusting."</p><p>Recognizing the backlash that they were receiving, the publishing house stated that it was going to postpone the release of the book, allowing friends and family time to grieve the passing of their loved one.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aaron-carter-s-twin-sister-angel-is-slowly-putting-the-pieces-of-her-life-back-together-after-his-tragic-death.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Aaron Carter's Twin Sister Angel Is Slowly Putting The Pieces Of Her Life Back Together After His Tragic Death">Aaron Carter's Twin Sister Angel Is Slowly Putting The Pieces Of Her Life Back Together After His Tragic Death</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Angel Carter is determined to let the legacy of her late twin brother, Aaron Carter live on.</p><p>"Out of respect for the Carter family, my client has decided to defer the further release of the book at this time," the statement from Balas Books read, according to 9News.
