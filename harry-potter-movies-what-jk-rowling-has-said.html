In recent times, a massive amount of books made it to the big screen to achieve this amazing feat. The most successful ones often change some details to accommodate the time limit of the movie and make sure the audience stays interested throughout the entire length of the adaptation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One such story is Harry Potter's adventure written by J.K. Rowling in the late 90s who recently gave the opportunity to her fans to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">listen to their favorite books read to them by celebrities</a>. Her books were such a success they not only sold millions of copies but their Hollywood adaptation made a huge impact on fans all over the globe. Some authors don't condone their creations' transition to the big screen, others -like Rowling- put the effort to guide the director to make sure the movies don't deviate from the original books.</p><h2 id=j-k-rowling-was-always-involved-with-the-adaptation-of-her-story-to-ensure-the-films-stayed-faithful-to-the-books><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>J.K. Rowling Was Always Involved With The Adaptation Of Her Story To Ensure The Films Stayed Faithful To The Books</span></h2><p>To make sure her books&nbsp;were accurately brought to life, J.K Rowling&nbsp;was always involved in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the production of&nbsp;the movies</a> and was always kept in the loop before any film was released. The author's contribution was very exciting for her and gave her a sense of accomplishment after seeing the final products.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-were-the-two-last-movies-about-rowling-gives-her-fans-a-straight-answer><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>What Were The Two Last Movies About? Rowling Gives Her Fans A Straight Answer</span></h2><p>When Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows reached the big screen, it was made to be in two parts. The first one as Rowling herself states is a "rogue movie" where it followed the rise of the resistance against Voldemort, while the last one is a "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">war movie</a>" where the climax ends in the battle of Hogwarts and shows the end of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What The Cast Of Harry Potter Has Been Up To Since Deathly Hallows</a></span></p><h2 id=after-it-hit-the-big-screen-rowling-realized-how-much-better-a-relationship-between-harry-and-hermione-would-have-been><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>After It Hit The&nbsp;Big Screen, Rowling Realized How Much Better A Relationship Between Harry And Hermione Would Have Been</span></h2><p>Many fans have pictured Harry and Hermione's relationship to become romantic at some point in the story. The situations those two have gone through should have built a connection much stronger than friendship and Rowling saw that when Harry and Ginny got together on the big screen. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In an interview for Wonderland, she stated: "In some ways, Hermione and Harry are a better fit"</a></p><h2 id=it-was-never-declared-in-the-books-that-hermione-was-a-caucasian-girl><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>It Was Never Declared In The Books That Hermione Was A Caucasian Girl</span></h2><p>Rowling made sure to never clearly describe Hermione's ethnicity, so the reader can&nbsp;see the character however their imagination takes her. She was persistent on the fact that Hermione is to remain a blank canvas that the fans can paint the details the way they want to.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=to-dodge-eight-hour-films-rowling-understood-that-some-details-from-the-books-had-to-be-spared><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>To Dodge Eight Hour Films, Rowling Understood That Some Details From The Books Had To Be Spared</span></h2><p>Many films in the series have missing details that were written in the books which, according to the author, is understandable and expected so the films wouldn't drag along for over 6 hours each. This kind of tolerance by the author made way to many compromises that not only created a successful franchise but also allowed Rowling to enjoy the entire process.</p><h2 id=leaving-dobby-out-of-the-goblet-of-fire-was-not-something-she-liked><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Leaving Dobby Out Of The Goblet Of Fire Was Not Something She Liked</span></h2><p>In an interview with Rowling, she admitted to not being a fan of Dobby's deletion from&nbsp;Harry Potter and the Goblet Of Fire since she believed him to be a very important part of the series as she portrayed in the final book. The films replaced him with Neville Longbottom to help Harry with the tournament.</p><h2 id=her-favorite-moment-of-all-the-movies-is-when-harry-realizes-his-fate-in-deathly-hallows><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Her Favorite Moment Of All The Movies&nbsp;Is When Harry Realizes His Fate In Deathly Hallows</span></h2><p>It isn't a secret that Rowling's favorite book is the&nbsp;Deathly Hallows, but her most favorite moment of all the movies is when Harry realizes what he needs to do to defeat Lord Voldemort. This moment is very special for the author since it marked the beginning of the end of 17 years of writing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-author-made-it-clear-that-she-only-wanted-british-actors><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>The Author Made It Clear That She Only Wanted British Actors</span></h2><p>Her conditions were clear when she decided to cast British actors to play the main characters of the movies. She wanted to make sure the actors&nbsp;didn't&nbsp;use fake British accents during the series so that the authenticity of the movies and characters remained untarnished (which gave the casters some problems).</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">An Inside Look At J.K.

Her answer came shockingly truthful, she reminded her interviewer that this world was her own for seven years before the world knew about it which makes it impossible for her to remove that part of her life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rowling-believes-she-has-done-the-story-justice-and-might-not-put-harry-on-the-big-screen-anymore><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Rowling Believes She Has Done The Story Justice And Might Not Put Harry On The Big Screen Anymore</span></h2><p>In most of her interviews, Rowling always declares the end of&nbsp;a member of the Potter family as the main character of her future work.&nbsp;In an interview with Variety, Rowling states: "[...]So I think pushing it on to Harry’s grandchildren really would be quite a cynical move, and I’m not interested in doing that.”</p><h2 id=she-stated-how-much-honor-the-three-main-actors-brought-to-their-respective-roles><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>She Stated How Much Honor The Three Main Actors Brought To Their Respective Roles</span></h2><p>Rowling always showed the utmost respect and admiration for the main actors who played Harry, Hermione, and Ron. She often shows her appreciation for he amazing cast. In her opinion, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint were perfect for their roles and truly honored their respective characters.</p><h2 id=she-made-sure-her-fans-knew-how-intense-and-close-dumbledore-and-grindelwald-s-relationship-was><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>She Made Sure Her Fans Knew How Intense And Close Dumbledore And Grindelwald's Relationship Was</span></h2><p>Although the books and movies that follow young Albus Dumbledore's story did not disclose the fact that Dumbledore is a homosexual,&nbsp;they did portray the deep connection he had with his friend Gellert Grindelwald. In one of her readings, Rowling revealed Hogwarts' headmaster's sexuality which was very well received by her fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-s-the-only-one-who-says-voldemort-s-name-correctly><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>She's The Only One Who Says Voldemort's Name Correctly</span></h2><p>Back in 2001, the first Harry Potter movie hit theaters around the world and became one of the most popular fantasy movies in recent years. Ever since then, fans believed Lord Voldemort's name was spelled with a "T" at the end. Rowling later tweeted her version of the name: the "T" is silent.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Photos Of The Harry Potter Cast Behind The Scenes</a></span></p><h2 id=seeing-another-actor-take-rickman-s-mantle-brought-her-to-tears-during-the-latest-play><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Seeing Another Actor Take Rickman's Mantle Brought Her To Tears&nbsp;During&nbsp;The Latest Play</span></h2><p>When&nbsp;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child hit theaters in 2016, Rowling was unable to hold back her tears when she saw the actor wearing Severus Snape's wig since it reminded her of Alan Rickman. They were very close after so many years working together and his passing was very hard for her.</p><h2 id=rowling-hinted-at-a-new-harry-potter-movie><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Rowling Hinted At&nbsp;A New Harry Potter Movie</span></h2><p>Are fans going to enjoy watching&nbsp;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child on the big screen? <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rowling tweeted a rather ominous image</a> with a caption that could be understood as a hint for an upcoming adaptation to her latest Harry Potter title.
