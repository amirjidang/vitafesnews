However, it also seems obvious that many of <a href=# rel=nofollow>the songs that Swift has written</a> strike her biggest fans on an almost spiritual level.</p><p>Since Swift has a unique bond with her fans, she has <a href=# rel=nofollow>a slew of extremely popular songs</a>. Some of which are about her boyfriends, perhaps including <strong><a href=#>Travis Kelce</a></strong>. That artist-fan bond also causes Swift's fans to care about things like <a href=# rel=nofollow>how she got her teeth fixed</a> and about her cats. Swift's fans also recognize that <a href=# rel=nofollow>her relationship with Travis Kelce seems different</a>. For that reason, it isn't surprising that her love of cats seems to be affecting Travis Kelce.</p><h2 id=is-travis-kelce-a-cat-person-now-because-of-taylor-swift>Is Travis Kelce A Cat Person Now Because Of Taylor Swift?</h2><p>From the moment that fans became aware that something was going on with Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, there have been a lot of haters. There have even been some people who have suggested a conspiracy theory about Swift, Travis Kelce, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ttweb_why-travis-kelce-didn-t-want-his-dad-to-talk-to-taylor-swift_bk_a1.jpg><p>Despite all that, however, there have also been fans who've focused on celebrating how happy Swift and Travis Kelce seem together. Among those fans, there was a lot of excitement when there was a headline about Travis Kelce potentially becoming a cat person because of Swift.</p><p>How big is Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's age difference, according to Britannica?</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">When was Taylor Swift born</a>?:</p></td><td><p>December 13, 1989</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Where was Taylor Swift born?:</p></td><td><p>West Reading, Pennsylvania</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">When was Travis Kelce born</a>?:</p></td><td><p>October 5, 1989</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Where was Travis Kelce born?:</p></td><td><p>Westlake, Ohio</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>How much older is Travis Kelce than Taylor Swift?</p></td><td><p>69 days</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unsurprisingly, Travis Kelce hasn't gone to the media to announce that he is a cat person. After all, that would be a weird thing for him to do. However, fans have come to believe that Travis Kelce is becoming a cat person because of something the tight end's sister-in-law said.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/have-taylor-swift-s-parents-secretly-profited-from-her-career_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Have Taylor Swift's Parents Secretly Profited From Her Career?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift's parents are very private which has left fans wondering if they profit from her career.</span><p>In December 2023, Travis Kelce was interviewed for a podcast titled "New Heights". For anyone who isn't familiar with the "New Heights" podcast, it is hosted by Travis Kelce's brother and sister-in-law, Jason Kelce and Kylie Kelce.</p><p>As the trio's conversation continued, Kylie Kelce spoke about how she wanted to get a cat. Unfortunately for Kylie Kelce, however, her husband, Jason Kelce, was very clear that he didn't want them to get a family cat.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not willing to give up on the idea, Kylie Kelce came up with the idea of getting Travis Kelce to help convince his brother to get a cat. As Kylie Kelce asked Travis Kelce for his assistance, she suggested <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">he might be a cat person now because of Taylor Swift</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/do-taylor-swift-s-cats-live-a-more-pampered-lifestyle-than-travis-kelce_-front-deposit-back-taylor-swift_ig.jpg><p>"No, here's the deal, I told Jason that I want to get a cat. And he told me no. And I feel like you might like cats now."</p><p>In response to Kylie Kelce's remark, Travis Kelce notably didn't deny he likes cats now because of Swift. Instead, Travis Kelce asked his sister-in-law what kind of cat she wanted.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Evidently, Kylie Kelce thought that Travis Kelce had become such a big cat person that he might just get her one. As a result, Kylie Kelce made sure to tell Travis Kelce during the podcast interview that she didn't want him to get her a cat.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/taylor-swift-was-offended-by-joe-jonas-pregnancy-rumors-during-an-access-hollywood-interview-front-deposit-back-instar.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Taylor Swift Was Offended By The Joe Jonas Pregnancy Rumors During An Access Hollywood Interview</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift told an interviewer how upset she was about pregnancy rumors involving her ex-boyfriend Joe Jonas.</span><p>"I don't want you to send a cat. I just want you to get on my team here."</p><p>Of course, Kylie Kelce suggesting Travis Kelce might be a cat person now is pretty compelling. After all, Travis Kelce seems to be close to his family, so his sister-in-law's opinion about him carries a lot of weight.</p><p>If Kylie Kelce did get Travis Kelce to agree she should get a cat, he didn't seem to help her much. Months after Kylie Kelce tried to enlist Travis Kelce, Jason Kelce stated <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">he still didn't want to have an indoor cat</a> during a January 2024 episode of his podcast. However, Jason Kelce did seem open to getting a cat someday if it lives outdoors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That said, if anyone feels that Kylie Kelce's comments aren't enough proof, there is more than that. Days before the aforementioned podcast was released, The Mirror US published a report about Travis Kelce wanting <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Swift's cats to feel welcome in his home</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ttweb_why-fans-are-speculating-that-travis-kelce-and-taylor-swift-will-announce-they-re-having-a-baby_bk_a1_v4.jpg><p>According to The Mirror US' article which quoted Dexumoi's Meggie Kempner, Kelce wanted to add features to a home he was going to move into for Swift's cats.</p><p>"'Before Travis moved into his new house, he was looking at adding some features into it that incorporated an interest of Taylor's,' Dexumoi's Meggie Kempner teased during a new episode of the Deux U podcast."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Mirror US's article continued, "According to the gossip blog, Travis was trying to be considerate of Taylor's beloved cats. Considering Taylor's three kitties, Meredith Grey, Olivia Benson and Benjamin Button, are very central to her heart, it wouldn't be unreasonable for him to keep her fur babies in mind."</p><h2 id=who-are-taylor-swift-39-s-cats>Who Are Taylor Swift's Cats?</h2><p>Since Taylor Swift is an absolute superstar, it is extremely safe to say that she leads an incredible life. As a result, it makes sense that Swift's fans love seeing photos from her life. That said, for many of Swift's fans, there is something special about photos of Swift with her beloved cats.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fans-noticed-an-icy-rift-between-travis-kelce-s-brother-jason-and-taylor-swift-here-s-the-truth-about-their-relationship_-front-right-_deposit-left-instar.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Fans Noticed An Icy Rift Between Travis Kelce's Brother Jason And Taylor Swift, Here's The Truth About Their Relationship</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Many Taylor Swift want to know about her relationship with Travis Kelce's Brother Jason and his wife Kylie.</span><p>No matter how much Swift's fans adore her cats, they can't care about them as much as the pop star does. In fact, Swift revealed to Time that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">she loves her cats so much</a> that she starred in one of the biggest box office flops of all time.</p><p>“I have cats. I’m obsessed with them. I love my cats so much that when a role came up in a movie called Cats, I just thought, like, I gotta do this.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/th-image-template-2.jpg><p>Of course, some people like to exaggerate how much they love things. However, when it comes to Swift and her cats, it actually seems like the pop star really is obsessed with her furry family members.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">How long has Taylor Swift had her cats</a>, according to Cosmopolitan?</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Taylor Swift got her cat Meredith Grey in 2011</strong></li><li><strong>Taylor Swift got her cat Olivia Benson in 2014</strong></li><li><strong>Taylor Swift got her cat Benjamin Button in 2019</strong></li></ul><p>According to Cosmopolitan, Swift cares about her cats so much that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">she reportedly takes them everywhere</a>.
