She is a dancer, an actress, a singer, and a businesswoman. She is also known for her world-famous curves and assets. She is one of the wealthiest stars today with an estimated net worth of $360 million. Her personal life is always making headlines and her relationships have people talking. She developed a reputation for being a demanding diva but it only adds to her image. She is regarded as one of the most beautiful Hollywood stars of her generation. Her naturally curvy body is world-famous but it doesn’t just happen. It takes a great deal of work to stay in the exceptional physical shape Lopez is in.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>J-Lo works intensely hard to stay in peak physical fitness. She works closely with two personal trainers to maintain a healthy lifestyle. She loves to work up an intense sweat and train hard. She has a hectic and busy schedule but manages to hit the gym for a training session. She balances her work, family, and healthy lifestyle better than most celebs. Here is a look at 20 Things Only J-Lo’s Personal Trainer Can Tell Us About Her Lifestyle.</p><h2 id=don-t-feel-like-you-have-to-be-perfect><strong>Don't Feel Like You Have To Be Perfect</strong></h2><p>There is a plethora of celebrity personal trainers in Hollywood that have worked with all the top stars. It can sometimes be difficult to decide which trainer to go with.</p><p><strong>That is probably the reason why J-Lo decided to go with two trainers.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tracy Anderson is a world-famous personal trainer and fitness entrepreneur. She is well-known for the Tracy Anderson Method and her collection of at-home training DVDS. Additionally, she launched an online fitness program called TA Video Streaming and has several gyms all over America. She stresses the importance of making working out a routine. She said, “You need to start now and actually make fitness a part of your lifestyle and then you can actually enjoy it and keep it. Don’t feel like you have to be perfect. Even if you can’t get perfect this summer, next summer you can.”</p><h2 id=training-with-tracy><strong>Training With Tracy</strong></h2><p>One of the world’s greatest mysteries is Jennifer Lopez’s ability to look younger with age and her incredible body. It takes a great deal of work with not one, but two, personal trainers. Tracy Anderson works closely with Lopez to get into stellar shape. Lopez meets with Anderson 4 to 5 times a week. Lopez has an insanely busy schedule but always has time for a workout. Anderson is good at adjusting and being flexible with Lopez’s hectic life. Anderson said,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"It can be anywhere from 30 minutes – if her kids need her for something, because she's always there for them – to an hour or an hour and a half."</strong></p><p>They work mostly with weights and concentrate on the upper body, core, thighs, and booty.</p><h2 id=the-sculpt-master><strong>The Sculpt Master</strong></h2><p>Jennifer Lopez has a reputation for being a demanding diva that has a long list of demands that must be met before she agrees to be in a movie. So, it really should come as no surprise that she would require two of the top personal trainers in the world. David Kirsch is a personal trainer, author, and founder of the world-famous Madison Square Club. He is known as the “sculpt master” and has worked with some of the most famous celebs, such as&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kate Upton</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Liv Tyler</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Heidi Klum</a>. He said, “For me, the way I go about training all of my clients is by using short bursts of interval training—it's the most effective for burning calories as well as for cardiovascular health and making you stronger.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=training-with-david><strong>Training With David</strong></h2><p>It takes two personal trainers to get the kind of body that J-Lo has.</p><p><strong>Her second trainer, David Kirsch, noted that the secret to her insanely fit body is she became “crazy disciplined.”</strong></p><p>Kirsch and J-Lo concentrate on her cardio with some intense circuit training. He said, “I’m not going heavy on the weight with her, but I keep the circuit up and the intensity up and the cardio up.” Kirsch’s circuit workouts usually features squats, burpees, lunges, and kickboxing. He also has her using medicine balls, resistance bands, and stability balls. These workouts help highlight her curvy figure. He added, “It’s about shaping and toning and sculpting. So it’s not a traditional strength workout and it’s not a pure cardio workout. It’s sort of a mix of both of them.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=muscle-fuel><strong>Muscle Fuel</strong></h2><p>A healthy diet is crucial to staying in the type of shape Jennifer Lopez is in. Working out intensely with two personal trainers isn’t possible without proper eating habits. She eats only organic food that is a balance of high protein and nutrients. She avoids all refined carbs, dairy, and sugar. She has a lot of protein to overcome her intense cravings. She said,</p><p><strong>“Protein is my go-to whenever I start having cravings. It fills me up and keeps me full longer. It's a great muscle fuel.”</strong></p><p>For breakfast, she has a protein shake and lunch features salmon with a vegetable heavy salad. For dinner, she usually goes with chicken or pork with quinoa. Additionally, she cut out all junk food and doesn’t touch coffee or alcohol.</p><h2 id=portion-control-is-key><strong>Portion Control Is Key</strong></h2><p>Fans are sometimes surprised to find out that Jennifer Lopez is 48 years old. It’s only a surprise because she takes such good care of herself that she seems to be getting younger. Lopez admits that her diet and portion control play an important role in her youthful looks. She said,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“You can hide a lot with good clothes, but when you’re doing a video, you really can’t, because the clothes get smaller. Portion control is the key.”</strong></p><p>Her meals never include any processed foods. For her snacks, she tends to stick with fruits and vegetables. However, she does indulge from time to time. In fact, her current boyfriend, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alex Rodriguez</a>, revealed on The View&nbsp;that she has a weakness for chocolate chip cookies and chocolate chip ice cream.</p><h2 id=j-lo-never-skips-leg-day><strong>J-Lo Never Skips Leg Day</strong></h2><p>J-Lo is known for stealing the spotlight anytime she walks the red carpet. She has worn some of the most sizzling and revealing outfits ever created. She often shows off her curvy figure in a scandalous dress. Her stunning and toned stems are often on display. J-Lo’s trainers stress the importance of never skipping leg day. She works hard on her lower body, and her legs play a major role in attaining her shapely rear. Tracy Anderson has two leg exercises that she finds work best for J-Lo. Using a three-pound dumbbell, she does the hydrant to arabesque and push-up with leg kick. She also does 30 seconds of high knees, jump rope, or mountain climbers for her lower body cardio workout.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=legs-legs-legs><strong>Legs! Legs! Legs!&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Jennifer Lopez made quite the name for herself as a recording artist. She is best known for the hit single, “Jenny From The Block.” She worked with all the top producers and artists throughout her career. She released several memorable albums, including&nbsp;On the 6, J. Lo, and&nbsp;This Is Me…Then. Jenny knows the importance of working on her legs. Tracy Anderson has a leg workout that many of clients enjoy doing.</p><p><strong>Her leg workout includes knee-to-shoulders, leg bends, and leg pulses.</strong></p><p>However, Anderson also stresses the importance of not overexercising. She noted, “Don’t overexercise large muscles. The large muscles in the legs are massive, and they want to become even more massive. Don’t do the same repetitive moments over and over and don’t use heavy resistance.”</p><h2 id=welcome-to-j-lo-s-show><strong>Welcome To J-Lo's Show</strong></h2><p>Jennifer Lopez decided to make a return to television. In 2016, she began portraying Detective Harlee Santos on the NBC crime series Shades of Blue.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Lopez works hard on her lower body but it’s essential to work the upper body as well, especially when portraying a NYPD detective.</strong></p><p>Lopez knows the importance of having a balanced workout and focusing on every body part. Tracy Anderson has an arm workout that Lopez loves to do. For her arms, Anderson has Lopez do wrist rotations, circle rotation, and twisting rotations. She also goes for the more traditional route and does dumbbell bicep curls, cable lat pull-downs, and lateral dumbbell raises. Lopez loves doing Anderson’s workout because she can do it while on the road and can also have sessions at Anderson’s personal studio.</p><h2 id=fighting-shape><strong>Fighting Shape&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Jennifer Lopez’ personal life and relationships often garner more attention than her albums and films do. She has been in several high-profile relationships, including one with music mogul <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sean Combs</a> and later, with actor/director <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ben Affleck</a>. She is currently dating former New York Yankee Alex Rodriguez. She was previously married to fellow musician <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marc Anthony</a> from 2004 to 2011 with whom she has twins, Maximillian and Emme.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>She managed to get back into stellar shape after giving birth out of sheer determination.</strong></p><p>Lopez&nbsp;trained with Anderson at her home and at Anderson's private studio. Anderson said, “Jennifer has an insane ability to move and connect with her body. Jennifer knows what it feels like to be in what she calls ‘fighting shape’ and after twins, it doesn’t just come back.”</p><h2 id=transcendental-meditation><b>Transcendental</b><strong>&nbsp;Meditation</strong></h2><p>Jennifer Lopez has starred in a number of memorable films. She had her big breakthrough when she portrayed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Selena&nbsp;Quintanilla-Pérez</a> in the biopic Selena. She went on to become a major movie star and recording artist. She manages to balance that with her training schedule. She discovered that hitting the gym 5 times a week and eating healthy isn’t enough to stay in shape.</p><p><strong>She found that transcendental meditation is a key part of it too. It helps her deal with the stress of life and with balancing her hectic schedule.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She mediates twice a day for 20 minutes each, and it helps her stay grounded. She said, “I learned transcendental meditation this year because it’s overwhelming at times. Doing all of the things I do, at once.”</p><h2 id=alternative-workouts><strong>Alternative Workouts</strong></h2><p>J-Lo’s personal trainers are strong believers in alternative forms of working out. It’s always important to get out of the gym and find other ways to workout. J-Lo loves to change her workout up and loves variations. She said,</p><p><strong>“I’m a big fan of a lot of different moments. I do big sequences back to back spliced with high intensity cardio stuff, which could be anything from a rower, to a stair climber, to a treadmill.”</strong></p><p>However, she loves to get out of the gym and get outdoors. She has several options for alternative workouts, including triathlons, TRX training, and boxing. It should come as no surprise that her favorite alternate workout is to get up on her feet and dance. For a workout, she loves all kinds of dancing, specifically Zumba dancing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-dancing-machine><strong>A Dancing&nbsp;</strong><b>Machine</b></h2><p>Dancing is a critical part of Jennifer Lopez’s life. In fact, she started her career as a backup dancer for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Janet Jackson</a> and New Kids on the Block. In 1991, she landed her high-profile gig at the time as a Fly Girl dancer on the sketch comedy In Living Color. She’s still dancing up a storm in her music videos, live performances, and just for fun. However,</p><p><strong>she also dances&nbsp;as part of one of her&nbsp;workouts, as it’s a great way to stay in shape and work up a sweat.</strong></p><p>Her personal trainers stress the importance of changing up a workout. Dancing is a great alternative to hitting the gym. She said, “Dance has always been a huge part of my life and taking the time to move my body and do something that’s so good for me is key to my happiness.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=j-lo-s-six-pack-secret><strong>J-Lo's Six-Pack&nbsp;</strong><b>Secret</b></h2><p>Jennifer Lopez is well-known for showing off a particular famous asset of hers. However, she also enjoys showing off her killer abs, and she should since she works so hard on them. David Kirsch has her doing stability ball scissors and stability ball pikes to get that cut six-pack. According to Kirsch, the secret to her abs is the side-plank oblique crunches. Kirsch noted,</p><p><strong>"It’s perfect for when you need to focus on shaping and toning not only the obliques but the entire core."</strong></p><p>Lopez posted a pic showing off her perfectly toned six-pack but was accused of Photoshopping, which she denied. Tracy Anderson came to her defense and pointed out the amount of work Lopez puts into training. She said, "Not only do her abs look every bit as good as in that picture, they look even better in person."</p><h2 id=j-lo-s-perfectly-toned-abs><strong>J-Lo's Perfectly-Toned Abs&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Jennifer Lopez is one of the most recognizable stars in the world. She has starred in several memorable films, including&nbsp;Out of Sight, Maid in Manhattan, and&nbsp;Monster-in-Law.</p><p><strong>Lopez is in unbelievable shape anytime she takes on a role.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In fact, she often shows off her killer and perfectly-toned abs in just about every film appearance. She has perfect abs because Tracy Anderson works her hard and pushes her to her max. For a warm-up, Anderson has Lopez do body rocks, hip stretches, second position pile, and body bends. It’s easy to see that Lopez excels at doing Anderson’s ab workout. Anderson’s ab workout for Lopez includes doing basic crunches, in & out crunches, 90-degree crunches, and crunch & extend.</p><h2 id=lots-of-sleep><strong>Lots Of Sleep</strong></h2><p>Jennifer Lopez is incredibly busy with her career and raising her kids. Her schedule is hectic between recording music and performing her stellar concerts. She also manages to find time for a film and television career. It might seem obvious but</p><p><strong>a key to Lopez’s healthy lifestyle is getting the proper amount of sleep, which is difficult with a schedule like hers.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She always makes sure to get lots of sleep and would ideally prefer a full 10 hours but a little less is fine. She said, “I love to get a good 9 or 10 hours sleep. But, I can never get that. So, 7 or 8 is mandatory. Otherwise, I just don’t feel right. I start feeling crazy, I get emotional and I feel tired all of the time.”</p><h2 id=j-lo-s-backside-workout><strong>J-Lo's Backside Workout</strong></h2><p>J-Lo has released chart-topping singles and&nbsp;starred in a number of memorable films. However, nothing gets her more attention than her famous backside.</p><p><strong>Although she has since denied them, there were rumors that suggested it’s so valuable to her that she even had it insured.</strong></p><p>One of her techniques is using the Tracy Anderson backside workout method. It features 5 exercises at 30 reps on each side. The workout includes arabesque lift to knee balance, attitude plank with alternating leg, standing plié knee tuck to attitude lift, plank hold with attitude lift and foot grab, and sidekick. It won’t look exactly like J-Lo’s but will give you a rump to be proud of and show off.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=enhance-that-backside><strong>Enhance&nbsp;That Backside&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Jennifer Lopez has worked with various trainers throughout her life. She is very happy with her current trainers but also worked with some others. She briefly trained with well-known celebrity trainer Gunnar Peterson. He’s worked with several top celebs such as&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Kardashian</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sofia Vergara</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Angelina Jolie</a>. Peterson has helped shape and tone some of the most famous behinds in Hollywood. He worked closely with Lopez and focused on her lower body. He said, “If you want to enhance the shape of your butt, as well as tone and tighten, the most important exercises are squats and lunges. Be sure to use weights, weights, weights… and then some weights!” For her lower body, J-Lo does wide dumbbell squats, side lunges, and skater lunges.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=j-lo-s-secret><strong>J-Lo's Secret</strong></h2><p>Aside from her extraordinary talents, J-Lo is best known for her world-famous derrière. She puts in a great deal of work to get that shapely backside. Her trainer, David Kirsch, is actually an expert when it comes to shaping rear ends. The secret to J-Lo’s famous behind is the sumo lunge. He said, “It’s the perfect butt-shaping, hip reducing, lower half-sculpting maneuver.” J-Lo starts with her legs slightly wider than hip-width apart. She lifts her right leg from the knee in a circular roundhouse landing out to the side. She squats down and as she comes up she kicks the right leg out. Kirsch added, “It targets the outer thigh and really lifts the butt, which seem to be two problem areas for a lot of women.”</p><h2 id=it-s-about-just-being-happy><strong>It's About Just Being Happy</strong></h2><p>A few years ago, it seemed&nbsp;like J-Lo was slowly starting to fade away from the spotlight. However, she was able to revitalize her career as a judge on American Idol. Eventually, she began a lucrative residency in Las Vegas. She has discovered that a key to having a healthy lifestyle is balance. Lopez wears many hats and takes on different projects. However, she is also a mother with two adorable little kids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>She never wants to skip a workout but will never neglect her many other responsibilities.</strong></p><p>She said, “It’s a whole rounded regimen…it’s working out, it’s dancing, it’s meditating. At the end of the day, it’s about just being happy, being with my kids. All of that helps balance out, so work doesn’t feel so crazy.”</p><p>Sources: popworkouts, bodyandsoul, Health, Poeple</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmhqYGLBqbXNoKpmp56hxm62jKWmrGWgmr%2B0u82ao2asopa2r7HRZpqapl2psq24jK6qZpmSpMK1eceeqWakmZuytMDYpZxo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kristen-bell-friendship-ryan-hansen-veronica-mars.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A Look Inside Kristen Bell's Friendship With Ryan Hansen">&larr;
