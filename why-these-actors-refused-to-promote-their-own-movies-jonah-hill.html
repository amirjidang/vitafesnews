"We were guinea pigs, in a way, Jim wasn't quite sure how this was all gonna go down… [in the drowning scene I was] screaming at her to come back and wake up, and I was slapping her across the face and I see that they've run out of film in the camera — there's a light on the camera — and nobody had said anything," Haris explained in a 2016 interview.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=david-hyde-pierce-won-39-t-promote-hellboy><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>David Hyde Pierce Won't Promote Hellboy</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/david-hyde-pierce.jpg><p>In Guillermo Del Toro's Hellboy the role of Abe Sapien was portrayed by contortionist Doug Jones.
