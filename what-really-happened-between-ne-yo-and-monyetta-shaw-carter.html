The news aroused curiosity in some fans, who can't help but look back at Ne-Yo's past relationships. One such relationship was with his ex-fiancée, reality TV star and author, Monyetta Shaw-Carter. The duo was together for several years and even have two kids together, they didn't make it down the aisle though.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Happened To Ne-Yo?</a></span></p><p>There was some controversy surrounding their split when fans learned that Monyetta had her tubes tied after the birth of her and Ne-Yo's son. Countless reports claimed that the singer had forced her to do so, a claim that both parties have renounced over the years. Their romantic relationship may have ended abruptly, but the exes are on friendly terms and co-parent their children. Shaw had a warm relationship with Ne-Yo's estranged wife Crystal, and the singer showed support for Monyetta's relationship.</p><h2 id=shaw-and-ne-yo-share-two-kids-together>Shaw And Ne-Yo Share Two Kids Together</h2><p>Ne-Yo and Monyetta met in 2009, at a Jamie Foxx concert, and were engaged a year later. They were together for several years and have two kids together.</p><p>However, two months before their wedding, they called it quits. Well, Ne-Yo did, he allegedly ended their relationship over the phone, which completely blindsided Monyetta.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A year after their split, the Miss Independent singer began dating Crystal Renay to the dismay of many fans. He was accused of leaving his ex-fiancée for Crystal.</p><p>The accusations got worse after he proposed to his lady shortly after they began dating. Monyetta was hurt, without a doubt. However, the trio found a way to get along and raise the kids in harmony.</p><h2 id=ne-yo-was-accused-of-forcing-monyetta-to-get-sterilized>Ne-Yo Was Accused Of Forcing Monyetta To Get Sterilized</h2><p>Monyetta has never accused the star of forcing her to have her tubes tied. However, fans seemed to think otherwise. They accused the crooner of forcing Shaw to get sterilized only to leave her and have kids with his now estranged wife.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite Shaw addressing and refuting the accusations, there are people who still feel that he did in fact force the reality star's hand.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">During an interview with the New York Post</a>, Monyetta revealed, "Sterilization was something Ne-Yo and I discussed thoroughly in the months leading up to the baby’s delivery. We had a daughter, Madilyn, in 2010, and two children seemed like more than enough for the both of us. Ne-Yo also agreed to undergo a vasectomy to show our mutual commitment to the relationship."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Beloved Celebrity Couples That Got Engaged But Never Tied The Knot</a></span></p><p>She added, "I was so busy caring for two young children, I just assumed Ne-Yo had followed through and had gotten the vasectomy. I trusted him so much that it never even crossed my mind that he hadn’t gone through with it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It hurts to see them parade their love on social media. They recently married, on February 20, and Crystal gave birth to their first son. She seems like a nice girl, but I would be worried if I were she. How does she know that he's not going to do the same thing to her that he did to me?"</p><h2 id=ne-yo-set-the-record-straight>Ne-Yo Set The Record Straight</h2><p>It's been several years since Ne-Yo and Monyetta's split, yet some fans still hold a grudge against the singer. He did multiple interviews to clear the air concerning Shaw's sterilization.</p><p>He even took to Instagram to answer a fan who queried him about the situation. Ne-Yo insists that he never forced his ex to get her tubes tied, in fact, Monyetta never said he did either.</p><p>The exes have been co-parenting their kids since their split and are seemingly in a good place. Shaw has even, on the face of it, found her soulmate; she married businessman Heath Carter in 2021.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ne-Yo told Hot 97's Nessa</a>, "In the name of clearing up confusion, let me go ahead and do it. Right, no I did not force anybody to tie or burn no tubes, that's not how it happened, okay?… We had a girl first, then we had a boy, when we found out it was a boy, we was high-fiving in the doctor's office. Yeah, we done!"</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Burnt Bridges Or Besties? The Truth About Pete Davidson's Relationship With His Exes</a></span></p><p>He continued, "The doctor asked while I'm down here should I take care of these tubes, she looked at me, I looked at her. She did this, I did this (this meaning shrugging their shoulders), she said go ahead. What I'm supposed to do? What am I gonna do? I can't force people to do anything. I'm not the person that imposes my will on no-body and that was not the case there."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Now, I will say that she didn't say that I forced her to tie her tubes. That's not what she said, people took that and turned it into that."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYr%2BmrculsGagkaW9prrEnWSbnaSssqa6jKecZrGfYq6vsIympqexlanBonnSoZiwZZOWv7Wx0Wg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-we-know-about-megan-mullally-and-debra-messings-feud-will-and-grace.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What We Know About Megan Mullally And Debra Messing's Feud">&larr;
