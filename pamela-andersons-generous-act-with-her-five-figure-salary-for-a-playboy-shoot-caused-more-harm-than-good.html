She donated her Playboy funds, but was called out by a Muslim group.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Anderson's plan was to donate to a charity helping the Indonesian diaster victims</a>. Anderson said on her website at the time, “I’ve just shot another Playboy cover that will debut in January for Hugh Hefner, at his request — I adore him. Playboy and I decided to do this, so I could donate earnings from the shoot to Waves for Water.”</p><p>However, the Islamic Defenders Front called the means of getting the funds, "against the law of God." The statement reads, “If she wants to be photographed naked, then she is challenging a bigger disaster to happen in Indonesia. It’s haram [forbidden]."</p><p>The donation was a sizable one on Anderson's part, giving her entire salary for a shoot of $25K. Anderson did not respond to the claims made by the Islmaic group at the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/untitled-design-16.png> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:07</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/taylor-swift-shocked-fans-after-revealing-intense-anxiety-around-her-new-music-leaking-deposit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Hugh Hefner And Playboy Had Major Plans For Taylor Swift To Completely Revolutionize The Company ">Hugh Hefner And Playboy Had Major Plans For Taylor Swift To Completely Revolutionize The Company</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>High Hefner and Playboy made Taylor Swift a tempting offer back in 2016, completely changing the direction of its magazine.</p><p>Despite Anderson receiving heat for his allegiance to Playboy, the celebrity felt differently about her time alongside Hugh Hefner. Although some former Playboy Playmates had haunting experiences with Hefner, the same didn't hold true for Pamela, who has always been complimentary of her time with the magazine.</p><h2 id=pamela-anderson-39-s-experience-with-hugh-hefner-in-playboy-was-a-positive-one>Pamela Anderson's Experience With Hugh Hefner In Playboy Was A Positive One</h2><p>In a now deleted homage to Hugh Hefner, Pamela Anderson spoke about what the Playboy founder truly meant to her. <a href=#>Anderson revealed she "took her power back" thanks to Hugh Hefner</a>. "I am me because of you. You taught me everything important about freedom and respect. Outside of my family. You were the most important person in my life," she said in the tribute post.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Anderson continued, "Everything anyone loves about me is because you understood me. Accepted me and encouraged me to be myself. Love like no one else. Live recklessly With unfiltered abandon. You said the magazine was about a girl like me. That I embody the spirit you fantasized about. I was the one.

That's why I did it. I just didn't want that feeling any more. Doing that first photoshoot gave me this little kind of portal on what it felt like to be a sensual woman. My sexuality was mine.

I remember looking at the pictures, thinking I still didn't like them but they're okay. And then I thought, 'Well, I really flipped the script."</p><p>Anderson would go on to enjoy quite the career. However, not every job was to Anderson's liking, especially the pay for a certain iconic role.</p><h2 id=pamela-anderson-was-quot-taken-advantage-of-quot-with-her-low-pay-in-baywatch>Pamela Anderson Was "Taken Advantage Of" With Her Low Pay In Baywatch</h2><p>It might be hard to believe, but early on, Pamela Anderson was making $1,500 per episode of Baywatch. She wound up with an upgrade of $300,000 near the end, but that was still little in comparison to the backend profits made by co-star David Hasselhoff. Anderson claims she didn't have the proper reps at the time. Anderson's son also reacted to his mom <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"almost making no money from Baywatch."</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/pamela-anderson-wearing-her-baywatch-swimsuit-on-the-lifeguard-tower.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“She was definitely being taken advantage of,” Anderson’s son, Brandon Lee told Variety. “It still feels weird, how there hasn’t been some sort of discussion with Amazon, or the ‘Baywatch’ producers to get her her fair share. It’s funny how it works with Dave Chappelle with Netflix; he can somehow go back and get paid for a show that he didn’t own anything of. And with the Amazon library deal, we didn’t get a penny.”</p><p>Despite the low pay, Pamela is doing just fine these days with a net worth of $20 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGinmqWVoa5urc2dnKurn6PAbrPEp5yrp6WoeqKv02auoqyYYrWmvoyfoK%2BdXZu2qMHRnmSsmZyWv7p5xaipZpldpbmixcGosGarmKS8tXnCmqysnZRiurC%2BxGafmqqdYsGprc1mnqinlGQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./patrick-duffy-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Patrick Duffy Net Worth  How Much is Duffy Worth?">&larr;
