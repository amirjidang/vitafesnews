The famous ex-Beatle knows this because money is practically no object to him with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his&nbsp;$1.2 billion net worth.</a>&nbsp;Or is it?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>McCartney has done a lot of different things to get that enormous net worth. His career as a Beatle and beyond has been one of the most successful of all time, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he's accomplished so much in his sixty years in the business.</a>&nbsp;He's raised <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">five kids who have turned out&nbsp;successful themselves</a>&nbsp;and has kept pushing boundaries and holding records into his late '70s.</p><p>But&nbsp;is McCartney&nbsp;cheap? Some fans think so. He might be wary of spending his billions, but that could be because he was burned in the past.</p><h2 id=mccartney-could-be-cheap-but-he-s-humble>McCartney Could Be Cheap But He's Humble</h2><p>Fans think McCartney is cheap because various stories online have all agreed on&nbsp;his frugality. Through seeing him out and about, watching his spending, they know this. But they could be wrong on his intention. It doesn't come from a place of greed.</p><p>He allegedly had a fight with his daughter, Stella, in public about college and was trying to convince&nbsp;her&nbsp;to go to a more affordable school. He allegedly wouldn't pay for&nbsp;her tuition if it wasn't.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sir Paul McCartney Almost Asked Taylor Swift To Perform ‘Shake It Off’ With Him This Summer</a></span></p><p>On other occasions, he's also allegedly made his party guests pay for their own drinks.</p><p>This might seem a little stingy but fans online say, "He is known not to spend money on frivolous things. He is well-grounded. No big toys for this boy," inferring that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">McCartney's cheapness comes from being humble</a>, as compared to some celebrities who waste their money on stupid things.</p><p>McCartney's humbleness probably comes from the fact that he grew up during the war, in Liverpool, England, a working-class city. People who grew up during that time are very frugal, "just in case," because the war and the time period changed them. The fan points this out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They quote him saying, "The type of people I came from, never saw better. I never meet anyone half as nice as some of the people I know from Liverpool who are nothing, who do nothing. They’re not important or famous. But they’re smart, like my dad was smart. People who can just cut through problems. The kind of people you need in life. The salt of the earth."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul McCartney Leads Tributes To John Lennon As The Late Legend Turns 80</a></span></p><p>Of course, McCartney did spend his money like any rockstar in the '60s but now that he's older he relates more to those people he left back in Liverpool and recognizes how to be a good person even though he has billions.</p><h2 id=he-might-be-cheap-but-he-s-not-cheap-with-his-charity-work>He Might Be Cheap But He's Not Cheap With His Charity Work</h2><p>As of this year, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">McCartney has supported 45 charities</a> and has donated millions over the years. Some of the charities he's worked with include Adopt-A-Minefield, Cruelty-Free International, Everyone Matters, Greenpeace, PETA, Red Cross, and the St. Francis Food Pantries and Shelters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Contrary to what McCartney's ex-wife, Heather Mills, has said about his unwillingness to donate more to charities, McCartney has donated tons of money to organizations like the Barbara Davis Center for Childhood Diabetes, Keep a Child Alive, Children with Leukemia and Teenage Cancer Trust. According to Forbes, McCartney gave $1,065,013&nbsp;to PETA alone.</p><p>If he hasn't personally given money to organizations, he's helped by raising money from appearing at benefit concerts, as was the case for Teenage Cancer Trust. He performed and raised $382 million for the organization.</p><h2 id=maybe-he-wants-to-protect-his-assets-because-he-s-lost-them-before>Maybe He Wants To Protect His Assets Because He's Lost Them Before</h2><p>Up until 2018, the whole of the Beatles catalog was not in McCartney's rightful ownership since he wrote the songs. The fight to get them back was long and painful for the artist.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul McCartney’s Handwritten Hey Jude Lyrics Sold For $910,000</a></span></p><p>McCartney's mistake was telling Michael Jackson about music publishing during their collaboration on "Say, Say, Say." In 1985, Jackson bought ATV's entire 4,000 song catalog, which included all 200+ Beatles songs, for $47 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After a fifty years battle, McCartney was finally granted ownership to his catalog (and the Beatles fans around the world rejoiced). But it probably left a couple of battle scars on him. He could have lost so much forever, so that notion had to have had some effect on how he spent his money.</p><p>When he just got them back he probably didn't want to do anything that could possibly let him lose them again.</p><h2 id=what-will-happen-to-all-his-money>What Will Happen To All His Money?</h2><p>If McCartney does like to ride in second class sometimes, that's ultimately up to him. Not all celebrities have to spend away their riches. There'd be a problem if he was stingy with charities and other things and being mean about it, but he has pretty good reasons for being smart with his money.</p><p>But with all the money, McCartney has to have some sort of plan as to where it will all go when he's gone. He might have been frugal with his kids when they were younger but they turned out better because of it&nbsp;and&nbsp;odds are they'll get everything when the time comes (but can we make McCartney immortal please?) anyway, then they'll never say you never give me your money.&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s How Stella McCartney Became One Of Today’s Best Fashion Designers</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdm66vv4ytn6Kmm2K9osHLZqScm5Gnwa%2Bx2GagrGWTnbKivI4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./why-is-jean-charles-moise-arrested-and-deported-to-haiti-africa-trip-and-wife-details-212043-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Is Jean-Charles Mose Arrested And Deported To Haiti?
