She has sold an impressive number of albums and <a href=#>has earned a massive number of hits</a>. Minaj's success has caused her to develop a hardcore, devoted fan base around the world.</p><p>However, with that fan base comes a level of responsibility. This is one Minaj has been accused of not always living up to.</p><p>On one occasion, Minaj came under fire when she denied a fan an autograph after he couldn't remember the name of her first mixtape. Another incident occurred when fans questioned whether the rapper used an autopen when selling signed copies of her album.</p><h2 id=nicki-minaj-fans-accused-her-of-using-an-autopen-when-selling-signed-cds-on-her-website>Nicki Minaj Fans Accused Her Of Using An Autopen When Selling Signed CDs On Her Website</h2><p>In 2018, Minaj released her "Queen" album and sold signed lithographs of the cover art on her website. While Minaj's fans were thrilled at first, they soon became disappointed after noticing how similar each copy was.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many fans noticed the signatures looked exactly the same and were located in the same position on the lithographs.</p><p>Minaj's fans began accusing the rapper of using an autopen to create the signatures. An autopen is a machine used for the automatic signing of a signature. It makes sense that a celebrity of Minaj's stature would use the machine to sign the many copies that fans purchased.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/instar53334933.jpg><p>However, it created a backlash among Minaj's fans who believed they were lied to.</p><p>One fan complained their copy was bent when it arrived in the mail, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">to which a Twitter user replied</a>, "Its a fake autograph anyway, its not signed by Nicki herself."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Geez, @NICKIMINAJ, thanks for sending out autopenned autographs to those who preordered a signed lithograph with your album," a user sarcastically wrote.</p><p>Another wrote that Minaj was "trash for selling signed lithos and using an auto pen machine and not even signing them. First canceled her tour and then this #trash #falseadvertisement #refund can’t wait for my AUTHENTIC ariana signed litho."</p><p>This wasn't the first time Minaj came under fire for allegedly using an autopen. In 2015, online users began accusing Minaj of selling fake autographed copies of her album "The Pinkprint."</p><p>"This is not only false advertisement on Nicki's part, but it's a huge stab in the back to her fans. It's not that hard to sign stuff," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one GagaDaily user wrote</a>.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/What-Happened-Between-Nicki-Minaj-And-Latto_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>What Happened Between Nicki Minaj And Latto?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Nicki Minaj might've went out of her way to start a feud with Latto.</span><p>Other users called it a "scam," while some were more understanding.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I can see why they are fake," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">someone wrote</a>. "They don't have a set number of how many are signed, they all are. Its not a special edition or first come first served thing."</p><p>They added that they "feel disappointed for the fans where her real signature really means something valuable and special."</p><h2 id=nicki-minaj-denied-a-fan-an-autograph-because-he-couldn-39-t-remember-the-title-of-her-first-mixtape>Nicki Minaj Denied A Fan An Autograph Because He Couldn't Remember The Title Of Her First Mixtape</h2><p>In 2018, a video surfaced online of Minaj signing autographs for fans. When one person asks Minaj for an autograph, she asks him to name the title of her first mixtape. When the fan couldn't remember the title, she seemingly refused his request.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pat McAuliffe of Barstool Sports wrote</a> that famous people "have to take a picture/give an autograph when someone asks for one."</p><p>"It’d be one thing if she was at dinner or with family but she wasn’t," he continued. "She was surrounded by people on the way to an event and took the time to embarrass whatever queen decided to stop and ask her for an autograph."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/instar53334930.jpg><p>However, there were some who noticed Minaj saying something about eBay when the fan couldn't remember the title. Some believe Minaj felt this wasn't a real fan, but someone just looking to profit off of her autograph.</p><p>"To be fair a lot of people get autographs just to sell on eBay, she seems to reference this in her response," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one Reddit user wrote</a>. "I don't blame famous people for reserving autographs for their bigger fans."</p><p>"What about fans in general?" another user responded. "You don't have to know everything about something to be a fan. That's the whole reason this sub exists, to tell off people who think that."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The original commenter responded, "Yeah but imagine from the entertainers perspective being asked for autographs just to see loads of it end up in eBay for money."</p><h2 id=nicki-brought-her-fans-on-stage-to-present-her-with-the-michael-jackson-video-vanguard-award-at-the-vmas>Nicki Brought Her Fans On Stage To Present Her With The Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award At The VMAs</h2><p>MTV announced Minaj would receive the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at the 2022 MTV Video Music Awards."The award is presented to artists for their outstanding contributions and profound impact on music video and popular culture," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the network said</a>.</p><p>Minaj joined previous Vanguard Award recipients such as Madonna, Janet Jackson, Jennifer Lopez, and Missy Elliot. Elliot was the last artist to receive the Vanguard Award in 2019. MTV had not presented the award for two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Nicki has broken barriers for women in hip-hop with her versatility and creative artistry," Bruce Gillmer, president of music, music talent, programming & events, Paramount and chief content officer, music, Paramount+, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told Billboard in a statement</a>. "She has shifted the music industry and cemented her status as a global superstar with her crossover appeal, genre-defying style and continuing to be unapologetically ‘Nicki’."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Nicki-Minaj-.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Nicki Minaj To Receive Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Minaj is set to receive the honor at this year's MTV Video Music Awards.</span><p>During the show, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">several of Minaj's fans presented her with the award</a>.
