The film boasts a perfect cast and a relatable story, and while filming with young actors <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">isn’t always easy</a>, David Mickey Evans did one heck of a job when making this film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The cast of the film has grown and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">changed a lot</a> through the years, even having <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a reunion</a> or two along the way. Patrick Renna stole the show as Hamilton Porter in the film, and many fans want to see what the actor looks like these days.</p><p>Let’s take a look and see what the Great Hambino looks like!</p><h2 id=patrick-renna-appeared-in-many-90s-movies>Patrick Renna Appeared In Many 90s Movies</h2><p>Back in 1993, Patrick Renna got the ball rolling on his film career, and during the 90s, he wound up landing a number of impressive credits that helped make him a recognizable child star. Renna had an incredible sense of comedic timing, and he regularly churned out memorable performances in the projects he appeared in.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of his first major credits in the 90s came when he appeared alongside Pauly Shore and Carla Gugino in&nbsp;Son in Law. Though the film did not receive the best reviews, it wound up finding an audience thanks largely to the popularity the Pauly Shore had in his prime. The movie has even maintained a following after all these years.</p><p>After a few smaller appearances, Renna would star&nbsp;in&nbsp;The Big Green, which was another sports movie that was geared for younger audiences. The soccer-centric flick was not a huge hit like&nbsp;The Sandlot, but it had its moments. Renna, in particular, was a riot in the film as Larry.</p><p>Another memorable movie that Renna took part in was&nbsp;P.U.N.K.S.,&nbsp;which was released in 1999. That movie also happened to feature a young Jessica Alba. The young Renna&nbsp;would go on to make a number of appearances in film and television projects as the years went on, including appearances on shows like&nbsp;The X-Files, Boston Legal, CSI, Bones,&nbsp;and&nbsp;GLOW.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is all great, but there is one movie that most people still know him best from.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's What Andy From 'The Andy Milonakis Show' Looks Like Now</a></span></p><h2 id=he-starred-in-the-sandlot>He Starred In ‘The Sandlot’</h2><p>1993’s&nbsp;The Sandlot remains one of the most popular movies to emerge from the 90s, and this is saying quite a lot, given the fact that the decade was filled with classics. It’s undoubtedly one of the most loved sports movies of all time, and despite being nearly 30 years old, this movie still manages to catch on with new fans each year.</p><p>In the film, Renna played Hamilton Porter, and he regularly steals the show. Ham can be kind of a bully, but he loves his friends and certainly loves getting under people’s skin. Hearing him taunt the Tigers during a game was great, as was his memorable trash talking of the same team at the sandlot itself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Renna’s Porter is responsible for some of the most quoted lines in movie history, including, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“You’re killing me, Smalls!”</a> The lines were great on their own, but Renna’s delivery is what kept them being quoted for decades on end. It is a testament to the excellent casting that the movie had.</p><p>While Renna never turned into a blockbuster film star, he did have an awesome career in the business. As time has gone on, people have gotten curious to see what he looks like now and where to find him. Turns out, he looks a lot like he did back when he was making kids laugh on&nbsp;The Sandlot.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">If You Liked The Last Dance, Check Out These Sports Documentaries</a></span></p><h2 id=what-he-looks-like-today>What He Looks Like Today</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On his public social media pages, fans can take a look and see that Renna hasn’t changed a whole lot in appearance since his time in the 90s. It’s uncanny how similar he still looks, which is a testament to some great genetics.</p><p>Renna has never shied away from the legacy that he left behind with&nbsp;The Sandlot, and he has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">taken part in reunions</a> throughout the years. His TikTok account has had more than a few videos go viral, and they are never afraid to go full&nbsp;Sandlot. He even got his son Flynn involved in one, and in that video, he revealed to the world that he calls his kid Smalls. Talk about life coming full circle.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'Sons Of Anarchy' Star Ryan Hurst Once Appeared In This Classic Sports Film</a></span></p><p>Based on what he has released on TikTok, the actor is still as funny as ever. It would be great to see him in some upcoming comedy projects, but for now, we will gladly take some of his hilarious TikToks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">These Are The Most Unexpected Movie & TV Cameos From Sports Stars</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tMCtZKGZnWK9sL7TnqlmnqKkum7Ax55krJmembmwwIylpqijo2K5qrfEZquonJGufA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./honorary-consulate-general-of-austria-in-houston-united-states.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Honorary Consulate General of Austria in Houston, United States">&larr;
