Among them is the relaxed villa located on the Northern Italy’s Lombardy region, Lake Como. The couple reportedly stays their time off relaxing at the private abode every summer with their twins. The massive villa runs through the Lake Como and is surrounded by tons of stunning buildings and houses of the picturesque town of Laglio.

At the time, it caught the attention of both the media and fans that often flock the entrance of the property in the hopes of seeing Clooney or even his family members. The property has 25 rooms in total.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>The Ocean’s Eleven actor</a> reportedly purchased the adjacent villa called Villa Margherita to help secure his privacy and the privacy of everyone staying at the villa. The town of Laglio also welcomes Clooney and his family very dearly that in 2015, the mayor of Laglio decided to issue some restricting order to stop the fans, the paparazzi and the media for ever approaching the luxury property. The lawbreaker will be expected to pay a fine of $544 even if they are 100 meters away from the property. The individuals not related to Clooney or not invited to the villa should maintain a distance to make sure they will not face some trouble.</p><h2 id=a-beautiful-getaway-estate>A Beautiful Getaway&nbsp;Estate</h2><p>https://www.pinterest.ph/pin/717339046881024514/</p><p>The three story luxury property boasts an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">incredible view of the Lake Como</a>.
