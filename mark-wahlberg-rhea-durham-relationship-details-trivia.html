The couple got married on a Saturday afternoon at Good Shepherd Catholic Church in Beverly Hills with just 12 people in attendance, which included their three little ones.</p><p>At this point in 2009, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark and Rhea's eldest</a> (Ella) was already five years old and their youngest at the time (Brendan) was just 10 months. A year later the couple gave birth to their fourth and final child, Grace. <a href=#>These days, the couple shares their lives as parents on social media.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=religion-is-at-the-forefront-of-their-relationship><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Religion Is At The Forefront Of Their Relationship</span></h2><p>Before Mark and Rhea got married, Rhea converted to Catholicism to honor Mark's devotion to the Catholic Church. In 2019, Mark revealed that he had a prayer routine to stay close to his faith.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who Was Rhea Durham Before She Married Mark Wahlberg?</a></span></p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Catholic-Link</a>, Mark said "I want to serve God and to be a good human being and to make up for the mistakes I made and the pain I put people through. That’s what I’m praying for, and I recommend it to anybody.”</p><h2 id=even-their-first-date-was-at-church><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Even Their First Date Was At Church</span></h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zimbio</a>, religion is so important to him that he made sure it was apart of his relationship with Rhea from early on. Mark said, "We met through a mutual friend in New York. I asked if she wanted to hang out the next day and she did, so I said, ‘Well, come to church with me."</p><p>He continued saying that Rhea "was raised a Christian, not a Catholic like me. She did come -- <a href=#>and now she’s converted.”</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-credits-her-with-the-life-he-has-today><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>He Credits Her With The Life He Has Today</span></h2><p>After meeting in 2001, Mark and Rhea have one of the longest-running relationships in the public eye. Their loyalty to each other is so strong that Mark actually credits her for the man he is today.</p><p>He told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a>, "She has helped me become the man that I am and created a beautiful life for me and our children." He continued saying that families need to make sure they have the right partner in their life, especially if they have children.</p><h2 id=they-always-wanted-four-kids><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>They Always Wanted Four Kids</span></h2><p><a href=#>Mark and Rhea have four children together</a>: Ella, Michael, Brendan, and Grace. And as it turns out, they always wanted a big family. Mark is the eighth out of nine children, and Rhea has two younger siblings. With both stars having multiple siblings, they wanted the same for their children.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Female Celebs Who Married Younger Men (& Their Age Gap)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“My Wife has always wanted four, two boys and two girls, so miraculously she got everything she wanted,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark said to Ellen DeGeneres</a>. But even with four kids, Mark isn't ruling out any more kids for their future. “She’s saying she’s done. But she still might have a change of heart! She loves being a mother, so she may end up wanting more," he said.</p><h2 id=kobe-bryant-rsquo-s-death-had-a-lasting-effect-an-their-relationship><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Kobe Bryant’s Death Had A Lasting Effect An Their Relationship</span></h2><p>On January 26, 2020, NBA legend Kobe Bryant lost his life in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California. With him was his young daughter Gigi. <a href=#>The tragic loss crushed the world because the deaths could have been prevented.</a> Knowing how big of a celebrity Kobe was, it's no surprise that celebrities like Mark Wahlberg and Rhea Wahlberg were affected.</p><p>Mark told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Extra</a> that his wife didn't want him flying after the loss of Kobe; “My wife, I had to go to Atlanta the day after, I just got back, and she was, like, paralyzed with fear and didn’t want me to travel,” he said. Mark and Rhea were also reminded of how precious time was and to hug their children a little tighter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rhea-39-s-not-always-a-fan-of-his-work><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Rhea's Not Always A Fan Of His Work</span></h2><p>As loving and supportive as Rhea is, she's not always a fan of her husband's job. For starters, Mark noted that his wife isn't a fan of him kissing anyone else. He told WENN, “If it has anything to do with me kissing somebody my wife’s not gonna like it so I’ll fight to get it cut out. Those are the more important issues."</p><p>But that's not all,<a href=#> she also didn't think joining Ted was a good idea</a>. While the two were on their way to the Oscars, Mark told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vulture</a> what Rhea thought about Ted. She said, "You’re the dumbest guy in the world, this will be the last you’re ever going to be at the Oscars, and you’re going to ruin your career." Luckily for him, Ted was a hit!</p><h2 id=but-she-rsquo-ll-always-defend-her-husband><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>But She’ll Always Defend Her Husband</span></h2><p>Rhea may not always like seeing her husband kiss other women on screen or sign on to projects that don't make sense but she'll always defend her man.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2015, Justin Bieber was asked to be the new face of their underwear line. Knowing that Mark was the former face in the '90s, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rhea made her thoughts known on the choice on Twitter.</a> "My baby was the 1st and the best. Not to mention...Wow, the retouching..." she tweeted. Unsurprisingly, Rhea got a lot of hate online from Bieber fans. <a href=#>The newly married Bieber</a> stayed mum as she simply backtracked on what she was saying.</p><h2 id=rhea-doesn-39-t-always-get-along-with-her-sister-in-law><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Rhea Doesn't Always Get Along With Her Sister-In-Law</span></h2><p>Mark and Rhea may have a picture-perfect family but it looks like even they have their problems. As close as Mark and his brother Donnie are, their wives (Rhea and Jenny McCarthy) appear to be at odds.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Boston Globe</a>, Rhea tweeted and deleted a sassy response to adult women who die their hair pink. Shockingly, this was right after her sister-in-law Jenny shared a photo of her with pink hair. <a href=#>Rhea apologized for her tweet after Donnie hastily responded to her on Twitter.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=their-kids-aren-39-t-fans-of-their-dad-39-s-youth><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Their Kids Aren't Fans Of Their Dad's Youth</span></h2><p>Before Mark Wahlberg became known for his acting abilities, he was known as rapper Marky-Mark. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, their kids get embarrassed when they hear "Good Vibrations."</p><p>After he and Rhea were at their son's football game, Mark said this about embarrassing his kid. “In the middle of the game, they start playing ‘Good Vibrations’. My wife is just cracking up laughing, but she’s looking at my son who’s basically burying his head in his helmet.”</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>10 Things You Didn't Know About Mark Wahlberg Back When He Was "Marky Mark"</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikmqqbYsSitMubnKufXae1pq2MnayroJGierOxy5qroqeeqLWqvIydnK2ZmaHAbsDRoq2imV8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./15-interesting-things-you-didnt-know-about-mr-fuji.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Interesting Things You Didn't Know About Mr. Fuji">&larr;
