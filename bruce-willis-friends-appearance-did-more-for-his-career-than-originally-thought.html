Willis began his career on the stage in off-Broadway productions before rising to fame in the movie business. His role in Moonlighting put him on the map as a young star, and from there, his career took off.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Best known for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his role as John McClane in the Die Hard franchise</a>, Willis has become a symbol for action films throughout the years. From Armageddon, The Sixth Sense, and Red, Willis has left his mark with some of the most action-packed films to date. But his appearance on Friends as Paul Stevens, the father of Ross’s girlfriend Elizabeth, was seen as unusual by some given his status as an established movie star, but it did more for his career than even he thought.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Movies To Watch On Amazon Prime If You Like Die Hard</a></span></p><h2 id=a-lost-bet>A Lost Bet</h2><p>Willis’ role on Friends came from a bet he made with Matthew Perry on the set of their film Whole Nine Yards. Willis was unsure how the movie would fair in the box office, but Perry was optimistic that it would be successful. Thus, the bet was born. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The bet relied on the film opening at number one</a> and that if it did, Willis would appear on Friends for free.&nbsp;Whole Nine Yards led the box office for three weeks in 2000 and Willis became the character of Paul Stevens free of charge. His role as Stevens was hilarious as it followed a father unsure of how to handle his daughter dating an older professional. However, an awkward position arises when Willis’ character and Rachel begin to fall for one another, creating problems between Ross and Stevens.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=emmy-win>Emmy Win</h2><p>Due to his outstanding performance, Willis won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series. That means Willis has won an Emmy for Friends over all the other cast members except for Jennifer Aniston and Lisa Kudrow, who also have one win. The Emmy win proved worthwhile for Willis because even though he was already a famous name, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it showed his ability to shine even in an environment where he was simply a guest star</a>. It also added to his clout as an actor and although his main appeal was as a movie star, his ability to transfer his talents to the small screen only enhanced his reputation.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Things Bruce Willis And Demi Moore Want To Keep On The DL About Their Daughters</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=willis-versatility>Willis’ Versatility</h2><p>Awards aside, Willis’s appearance on Friends proved just how versatile the actor could be. His dramatic work mirrored with his action style could have very easily pigeon-holed him into that one genre of entertainment. Appearing on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a light-hearted, family sitcom like Friends</a> showed that Willis was relatable and willing to take risks in the comedic realm of the industry. Although he&nbsp;was&nbsp;tagged as an action star in his career and put into that niche category of explosive actors, to look back and enjoy his recurring role on Friends is something fans can revel in all because of a lost bet with Perry.</p><p style=text-align:left><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Aniston Said No To 'SNL' Alongside Adam Sandler To Become Part Of 'Friends'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZq62Tmnq4tculoKxllqe2prrDrGSaqKCarrOtzZycZpyZmXquu9GeZJ%2BnomK1qr%2BMnJirnZWnerW0wKdkqKqZnLavrculsGasmKTCqLTTaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./dan-donegan-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dan Donegan Net Worth | TheRichest">&larr;
