The two are always posting about their trips to the sand dunes together as well as their various get-togethers and holiday parties (which sometimes feature inappropriate gifts).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Kristen Bell's Best Performances, Ranked By IMDb</a></span></p><p>The duo has been best friends for nearly two decades now, and their friendship is still going strong. Bell even sent Hansen a video once while she was peeing. If that's not a close friendship, we don't know what is. The best part is that their spouses are definitely friends with them, too! <a href=#>Bell's husband Dax Shepard</a> and Hansen's wife, Amy, are definitely a part of their friendship group. Let's take a look down memory lane and take a deep dive into Bell and Hansen's friendship over the years.</p><h2 id=ryan-hansen-is-the-godparent-to-kristen-bell-39-s-kids><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Ryan Hansen Is The Godparent To Kristen Bell's Kids</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hansen is the godfather to <a href=#>Bell's two daughters, Lincoln and Delta</a>. On Hansen's 39th birthday in 2020, Bell wrote on her Instagram account, "he is The Godfather to my kids, and 1/2 of my super spouses. To say I love having him in my life is an understatement. I simply would not be the person I am today without his friendship and the people he has brought into my life." So sweet. Bell also said that "he makes me laugh so much and he once spent my birthday with a cardboard cutout version of me when he couldn't spend it with me." Hilarious!</p><h2 id=kristen-bell-and-ryan-hansen-go-on-family-vacations-together><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Kristen Bell And Ryan Hansen Go On Family Vacations Together</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The two families have been on many vacations and trips together over the years, including many trips to the Glamis sand dunes, where the men like to drag race, as well as trips to the Michigan lakes for the Fourth of July. During these trips, it's easy to see how well Ryan Hansen and Dax Shepard get along with each other, such as a photo that Bell posted featuring the two men showing off their muscles in the water in Michigan. Between the two couples, they have five daughters, and their kids are most definitely friends, as well. Hansen has three daughters and Bell has two.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Kristen Bell Voiced This Character In An Iconic Video Game Franchise</a></span></p><h2 id=kristen-bell-and-ryan-hansen-hang-out-and-rollerskate-together><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Kristen Bell And Ryan Hansen Hang Out And Rollerskate Together</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There have been videos posted online of Bell's husband, Dax Shepard, rollerskating with Hansen in the middle of their street during the pandemic. There have also been videos posted online of the two families at roller rinks together on various birthday party excursions. "I have known Ryan Hansen since we were baby-people," Bell wrote on an Instagram post once for Hansen's birthday. "He was my arch-nemesis on Veronica Mars, but became my best friend in real life. After VMars we became roommates, and (self-proclaimed) brothers. We hang out almost every day because we love hanging out together."</p><h2 id=kristen-bell-and-ryan-hansen-have-christmas-parties-together><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Kristen Bell And Ryan Hansen Have Christmas Parties Together</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The two best friends notoriously have Christmas parties together each year when they invite all of their friends and have a party where they exchange gifts. Hansen and Bell have famously gifted each other back and forth a piece of furniture that they decorate in a not safe for work kind of way. Also, one year, the best friends and their spouses shared a photo wishing everyone a "Merry Kissmas." The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">photo featured Kristem Bell kissing Amy Hansen, and Ryan Hansen kissing Bell's husband, Dax Shepard</a>. They deemed their spouses the "super spouses" and showed just how close and comfortable they truly are with each other. Amazing!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Kristen Bell Is A Gaming Fanatic, And This Role Proves It</a></span></p><h2 id=kristen-bell-and-ryan-hansen-were-in-each-other-39-s-covid-pods><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Kristen Bell And Ryan Hansen Were In Each Other's COVID Pods</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the pandemic, Bell and Hanson wouldn't dare spend time apart, so they of course included each other's family in their pod of people that they allowed themselves to hang out with. They even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">road-tripped together to various places in California</a> and took a trip to Sedona, Arizona, where Bell shared that it was "hot as Hades." They stayed in their pod during the pandemic while traveling in their RV to stay safe. Smart move!</p><h2 id=kristen-bell-and-ryan-hansen-send-each-other-intimate-videos><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Kristen Bell And Ryan Hansen Send Each Other Intimate Videos</span></h2><p>The two besties enjoy sending each other intimate videos of themselves on the toilet. Well, at least Kristen does. Hansen once posted a video on Instagram that Bell sent him while she was peeing. For most people, that would be totally embarrassing, but not for Bell, who clearly has no shame. The video started out with Bell saying "hey buddy, I'm peeing." Hilarious! She went on to say that she was sorry that his show didn't get picked up and that she was rooting for it to. She added that she would see him the next day and that they would have a Game of Thrones watch party on Sunday. Hansen wrote in the caption "when your best bud tries to cheer you up but ends up just PISSING you off." That's what friends are for.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ryan-hansen-39-s-wife-was-the-witness-at-kristen-bell-and-dax-shepherd-39-s-wedding><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Ryan Hansen's Wife Was The Witness At Kristen Bell And Dax Shepherd's Wedding</span></h2><p>Bell and her husband, Dax Shepard, decided to get married at the courthouse one morning when they were both free from working and asked Hansen's wife, Amy, to be their witnesses. According to Cinema Blend, the day the two got married, Bell had to film sex scenes with Hansen on House of Lies. "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">So I married my husband and then fake-had-sex with his best friend all afternoon</a>." Gotta love that friendship!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Fans Can't Believe 'Veronica Mars' Was Replaced By This Failed Reality Show</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiiq6GjqbKvecGeo6Vllqe2prrDrJ%2BiqF2nxqK6jKGYp6uVo3q3sdGopaKbkWK6or7SaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./a-peek-inside-george-clooneys-lake-como-villa.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A Peek Inside George Clooney's Lake Como Villa">&larr;
