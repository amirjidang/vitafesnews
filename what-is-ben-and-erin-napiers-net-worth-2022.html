After all, the top HGTV shows all seem to have a similar comforting tone and most of the network’s stars come across as wholesome. In reality, however, every HGTV show is unique in its own way and a portion of the reason that is the case is due to each series’ stars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>15 Surprising Secrets Behind HGTV Shows</a></span></p><p>Since each HGTV host brings their own element to the network, it makes sense that they are paid different amounts for their hosting duties. For example, some people wonder <a href=#>if Bryan And Sarah Baeumler are HGTV’s richest stars</a> while other people think that <a href=#>Mina Starsiak Hawk’s net worth</a> may put her at the top of the heap. No matter how much their fellow HGTV stars are worth, it definitely is worth noting that Ben and Erin Napier have accumulated a truly impressive fortune.</p><h2 id=how-much-are-ben-napier-and-erin-napier-worth>How Much Are Ben Napier And Erin Napier Worth?</h2><p>As every HGTV fan will already know, the popular network’s programming is focused on “reality” shows that are focused on buying or renovating homes. Despite that, there has been some conjecture about whether or not HGTV’s House Hunters is real. Of course, there are loads of rumors about <a href=#>other fake “reality” shows</a> so that shouldn’t come as too much of a surprise to anyone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>It Turns Out These Reality TV Shows Were Always Scripted</a></span></p><p>Since most people will never even meet their favorite HGTV star let alone get to know them on a personal level, there is no way to know for sure if they are the same off-camera. Despite that, based on everything that is known about Erin and Ben Napier, it seems very safe to assume that there is nothing fake about them. After all, from all accounts, the Napiers are as adorable in real life as they are on television.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though it certainly seems like there is nothing fake about the way Ben and Erin Napier come across on television, it should still go without saying that fans know it all about the couple. After all, based on how the Napiers come across during episodes of Home Town and their other shows, most of their fans would never guess how wealthy the couple is.</p><p>Thanks to the fact that Erin and Ben Napier have been TV stars for years, it shouldn’t surprise anyone that they are doing well financially. On top of that, the fact that the Napiers have become more of a presence on HGTV thanks to Home Town’s spin-offs indicates that the duo must be cashing in. Even with all of that in mind, many of the Napiers’ fans would be surprised to learn that according to Closer Weekly, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the couple has a combined estimated net worth of $5 million</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-ben-napier-and-erin-napier-spend-their-impressive-net-worth>How Ben Napier and Erin Napier Spend Their Impressive Net Worth</h2><p>Thanks to their busy schedule as TV stars and all of their side projects like launching a furniture collection, it seems clear that Erin and Ben Napier don’t have that much free time. However, when the power couple isn’t busy burning both sides of the candle and taking care of their kids, they get to enjoy an incredible lifestyle thanks to the fortune they’ve amassed.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Does The Property Brothers' Net Worth Compare To Other HGTV Stars?</a></span></p><p>Of course, any fan of Ben and Erin Napier will already know that the couple is incredibly talented at restoring and renovating homes. With that in mind, it would just feel wrong if the Napiers bought a brand new megamansion as some other stars do. Thankfully, that isn’t the case as the Napiers live in an old house they bought in Laurel, Mississippi.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Erin and Ben Napier are accustomed to being on camera, it makes sense that they have been willing to talk to reporters about their gorgeous home. As a result, it is known that the couple’s Mississippi residence is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a 1925 craftsman-style home</a> that would have cost them a pretty penny. After all, the Napiers allowed their home to be photographed, and to say that it looks gorgeous inside and out is an understatement.</p><p>When Ben and Erin Napier aren’t staying at home with their dogs and kids, they can hit the road in style. After all, anyone who follows the couple on social media will know that they routinely post images of themselves with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their gorgeously restored vintage truck</a>. While it is unclear how much cash the couple has spent on their cherished truck, there is no doubt that it would have been a sizable expense. After all, even the truck’s custom paint job which looks incredible would have been expensive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the end of the day, it seems clear that Erin and Ben Napier aren’t going around flaunting their fortune in front of the world likely because they aren’t those kinds of people. However, at the same time, it seems clear that the Napiers enjoy a lifestyle that most people could only dream of.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The Truth About 'Home Town' Star Ben Napier's Brothers And What They Do For A Living</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecGepWaZnpl6pr7Ip2SnmaCesrO%2FjKecrWWnpL%2B1tIxrZ2tqXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./tim-allen-honors-home-improvements-wilson-on-last-man-standing.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tim Allen Honors Home Improvement's Wilson on 'Last Man Standing'">&larr;
