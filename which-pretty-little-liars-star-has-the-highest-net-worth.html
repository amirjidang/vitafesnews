The TV drama, which ran for seven seasons, captivated viewers with its mysterious tale of a teenage girl named Alison DiLaurentis who was suddenly gone from her town, Rosewood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ali's best friends Emily Fields (Shay Mitchell), Hanna Marin (Ashley Benson), Spencer Hastings (Troian Bellisario), and Aria Montgomery (Lucy Hale) hated being left behind, and they were also stalked by a figure named "A," so they were busy solving the mystery.</p><p>Even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Demi Lovato loves PLL</a>, and the show has many loyal fans. It's interesting to compare the net worths of the major players and see who has the&nbsp;most&nbsp;money.</p><h2 id=troian-bellisario-s-10-million-net-worth>Troian Bellisario's $10 Million Net Worth</h2><p>Some of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PLL actors have spent a lot of money on things</a>, and so it makes sense that they all have a lot of money in the bank.</p><p>According to&nbsp;Celebrity Net Worth, many of the stars&nbsp;of&nbsp;Pretty Little Liars&nbsp;have done really well for themselves. Lucy Hale, Shay Mitchell,&nbsp;Ashley Benson&nbsp;have a net worth of $6 million. Sasha Pieterse has a bit of a lower net worth of $2 million, and Ian Harding has a bit more as his net worth is said to be $4 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Spencer-Hastings-Pretty-Little-Liars.jpg><p>With a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$10 million net worth</a>, Troian Bellisario is the&nbsp;Pretty Little Liars'&nbsp;main&nbsp;cast member with the most money.</p><p>Celebrity Net Worth&nbsp;notes that she began acting when she was only a toddler and was in a movie called&nbsp;Last Rites&nbsp;that came out in 1988.</p><h2 id=pll-salary>'PLL' Salary</h2><p>How much did the cast of&nbsp;PLL&nbsp;get paid for the episodes they starred in?</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lucy Hale made $42,000 for each episode</a>, according to&nbsp;Cheat Sheet.&nbsp;It seems reasonable to assume that Bellisario would make the same salary and that all of the girls would be paid the same per episode since there were five main characters.</p><p>It's safe to say that Bellisario made the bulk of her money starring on&nbsp;PLL&nbsp;for seven years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pretty Little Liars: Fan Theories We Can’t Ignore</a></span></p><h2 id=other-projects-and-roles>Other Projects And Roles</h2><p>Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen fans will definitely remember the 1998 film&nbsp;Billboard Dad.&nbsp;It turns out that Bellisario had a role in that movie and played the character of Kristen.</p><p>The actress had many film roles over the years, most notably the 2018 science-fiction&nbsp;movie&nbsp;Clara. She appeared in that film alongside her husband Patrick J. Adams.</p><p>Bellisario also wrote, produced, and acted in the movie&nbsp;Feed, which seems to be a passion project for her. The movie tells the story of Olivia, who suffers from an eating disorder after the death of her twin, Matt (played by Tom Felton).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Troian-Bellisario-In-Feed-Movie.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a 2017 interview with&nbsp;Variety.com, Bellisario talked about the movie and shared that she was personally connected to it as she suffered from anorexia and was in the hospital for it. She started to work on the script at the young age of 23 and worked on it for many years.</p><p>Bellisario explained, "Over the eight years of slipping back into some unhealthy places and then getting back to it and speaking to therapists, it was amazing to have ‘Feed’ to go back to and think, ‘This is what it felt like when it was happening, but now I’m five years out, now I’m six years out, now I’m eight years out, and now, how do I feel about this, as an artist talking about this as a story — and not as my own story?’ I felt like I really needed that distance to be able to see it clearly.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ashley Benson Posts ‘Pretty Little Liars’ Reunion Pics… But Where’s Lucy Hale?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=playing-spencer>Playing Spencer</h2><p>Whenever Bellisario has talked about playing the role of Spencer Hastings, she has nothing but good things to say about the character who brought her fame and fortune.</p><p>According to&nbsp;Cheat Sheet, she said that the show was so enjoyable due to the super crazy and surprising storylines. She explained, “It was all insane. I think the really fun thing about<a href=#> Pretty Little Liars</a> is you could say that we jumped the shark in the first minute. One of our long-term directors really put it well when he said that the plotlines are fantastic, but the emotions are real, so there’s no place that you couldn’t go."</p><p>The actress said in an interview with&nbsp;Teen Vogue&nbsp;that she was surprised that she named her daughter Aurora as, of course, her first initial begins with the letter "A." This reminds fans of the figure who stalked the liars for all seven seasons of&nbsp;Pretty Little Liars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She joked, "Oh my God, I've done it to myself!" and continued, "I have nobody to blame for this, and it's so funny that a motif will crop up in your life totally unconsciously."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Things The Cast Of Pretty Little Liars Have To Say About Working On The Show</a></span></p><p>PLL&nbsp;fans&nbsp;are definitely interested to learn that out of the main cast, the girl behind Spencer Hastings is the one with the highest net worth.
