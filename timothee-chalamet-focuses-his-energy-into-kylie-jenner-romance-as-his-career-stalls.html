However, a new report claims the actor’s career has stalled.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But rather than fretting over a lack of career opportunities, Timothee is apparently focusing on his new romance with Kylie Jenner. After months of speculation, the couple went public with their romance at Beyonce’s Renaissance tour stop in Los Angeles earlier this month, before packing on the PDA at the US Open.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: &nbsp;<a href=#>Kendall Jenner Disses Her Sisters By Revealing Why She Refuses To Open A Beauty Brand Like Them</a></span></p><p>An insider, who allegedly has significant interactions with the movie star, <a href=#>informed The U.S. Sun</a> that the ongoing actors' strike has enabled him to focus all of his attention on Kylie.</p><p>“The strikes have forced him to not work and actually have a personal life and a social life,” the source explained. “This relationship has turned his world upside down, and he's having the time of his life.”</p><p>The actors' strike, causing a halt in Hollywood productions, commenced on July 14 of this year and continues on. This followed a prior walkout by Hollywood screenwriters on May 2.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>News of Kylie and Timothee's romance made headlines before they were seen together as a couple, although Kylie's car had been photographed at Timothee's residence several times over the past few months.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Initially, reports suggested that the pair's relationship was purely casual, especially considering Kylie's breakup with Travis Scott last year, who is the father of her two children.</p><p>"They are keeping things casual at this point," an insider dished to <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> in August. "It's not serious, but Kylie is enjoying hanging out with Timothée and seeing where it goes.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“It's been really fun for her because it feels a lot different than her past relationships,” they continued. “It's new and exciting for Kylie and she's having a lot of fun."</p><p>To make matters more complicated, it’s been reported that Travis Scott is having a hard time seeing Kylie move on with Timothee.</p><p>“Travis is not thrilled about Kylie moving on, but they are still cordial and focused on co-parenting and being the best parents they can be,” <a href=#>a source told PEOPLE</a>.</p><p>“Although Travis understands that Kylie is free to date whoever she wants, he’s not exactly ecstatic about the whole situation [with Timothée],” <a href=#>a different source told Us Weekly</a>. “Despite his feelings, Kylie and Travis have both been very mature about their split and are focused on co-parenting in a healthy manner.”</p><p>But with Timothee not booking any acting roles amid the ongoing strike, it looks like he and Kylie have a lot of time on their hand to build their romance. And judging by recent photos, the two are enjoying their time together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: &nbsp;<a href=#>Britney Spears Is Preparing For A Musical Comeback As Her $60 Million Fortune Remains At Stake Amid Divorce</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqrnOrZ%2BenV2YtaK4wKacrWWWpLC2v8SsZKGho2Kyr7HRoLBmoZ6pvG632KWgnmWamruvsdFmqailkaOwpnnArGShoaNisKK%2BxJ6pZquklrmtv44%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./tom-joyner-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tom Joyner Net Worth  How Much is Joyner Worth?">&larr;
