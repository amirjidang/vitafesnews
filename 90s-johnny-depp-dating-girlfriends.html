From Winona Ryder to Kate Moss — keep on scrolling to see just which famous ladies that actor was linked to in that decade!</p><h2 id=johnny-depp-dated-winona-ryder><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Johnny Depp Dated Winona Ryder</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/winona-ryder-via-TV-Insider.jpeg><p>Kicking the list off is one of Johnny Depp's most well-known '90s relationships — the one with fellow Hollywood star Winona Ryder. The two actors dated from 1989 until 1993. They met at a movie premiere while in the lobby of a New York theater. In an interview with Rolling Stones, Depp talked about the moment their eyes locked for the first time. "It was a classic glance," the actor revealed, "like the zoom lenses in West Side Story, and everything else gets foggy."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In July 1991, the couple got engaged, and Depp got the phrase 'Winona Forever' as a tattoo. However, the two never made it to the altar. Depp and Ryder broke up in late 1993, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the actress opened up about how difficult the breakup was for her</a>. "I was very depressed after breaking off my engagement with Johnny," Ryder admitted. "I was embarrassingly dramatic at the time, but you have to remember I was only 19 years old."</p><h2 id=johnny-depp-dated-kate-moss><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Johnny Depp Dated Kate Moss</span></h2><p>Another one of Johnny Depp's famous flames from the '90s is British model Kate Moss. Celebrity columnist George Wayne claimed to have introduced the two at a cafe in New York City. "I had no idea that they would then become the IT couple for seasons to come, destroying hotel rooms across the globe during their still unforgettable union," he said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="The Real Reason Angelina Jolie Took On Her Role With Johnny Depp In The Tourist">The Real Reason Angelina Jolie Took On Her Role With Johnny Depp In The Tourist</a></span></p><p>Unfortunately, the 'It couple" broke up in March 1998. In an interview with Hello magazine, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Depp opened up about the split</a>. "I have never got that emotional over a woman before. I have been so stupid because we had so much going for our relationship. I’m the one who has to take responsibility for what happened – I was difficult to get on with, I let my work get in the way and I didn’t give her the attention I should have done," the actor said at the time. "The whole thing was crazy because I should never have got so worked up over what people had to say about my work. Sure, I should care about my movies but when I get home, I should try to leave that stuff behind. I couldn’t do that, and I was horrific to live with. Trust me, I’m a total moron sometimes."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2022, Moss testified on behalf of Johnny Depp in his <a href=#>defamation trial against Amber Heard</a>.</p><h2 id=johnny-depp-dated-vanessa-paradis><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Johnny Depp Dated Vanessa Paradis</span></h2><p>In May 1998, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Johnny Depp started dating French singer Vanessa Paradis</a> after meeting her while filming the thriller drama movie The Ninth Gate. "She was wearing a dress with an exposed back and I saw that back and that neck, and then she turned around and I saw those eyes, and — boom!" Depp told the Daily Mail in 2011. "You have this feeling — I can’t really explain what it was, but I had it when I met her. I saw her across a room and thought: ‘What’s happening to me?’"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, the couple never got married. In an interview with OK magazine, Depp opened up about their decision to not exchange vows. "I never found myself needing that piece of paper. Marriage is really from soul to soul, heart to heart. You don’t need somebody to say, OK you’re married. If Vanessa wanted to get hitched, why not. But the thing is, I’d be so scared of ruining her last name! She’s got such a good last name."</p><p>Together, Depp and Paradis have two children: daughter Lily-Rose born in 1999, and son Jack born in 2002. In early 2012, the two stars went their separate ways after spending 14 years together.</p><h2 id=johnny-depp-dated-juliette-lewis><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Johnny Depp Dated Juliette Lewis</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Back in 1993, Johnny Depp was linked to musician and actress Juliette Lewis. The two stars met on the set of the drama romance movie What’s Eating Gilbert Grape?, and they <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly quickly grew fond of each other</a>. However, neither ever confirmed a relationship, and even if there was one it did not last long.</p><h2 id=johnny-depp-dated-naomi-campbell><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Johnny Depp Dated Naomi Campbell</span></h2><p>Another model that Johnny Depp was linked to back in the '90s is British beauty, Naomi Campbell. The two stars were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">briefly linked in 1998</a>, but quickly after the actor began his relationship with Vanessa Paradis.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Why Did Lily-Rose Depp Really Drop Out Of High School?">Why Did Lily-Rose Depp Really Drop Out Of High School?</a></span></p><p>However, some believe that the two were never romantically involved, but rather that they were just close friends.

However, despite what the public thought at the time, the actress claims the two have never been anything more but good friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=johnny-depp-dated-traci-lords><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Johnny Depp Dated Traci Lords</span></h2><p>And finally, wrapping the list up is Traci Lords who starred alongside the actor in <a href=#>the 1990 musical comedy Cry-Baby</a>. It was back then, that the two reportedly also hooked up, and in her autobiography, Underneath It All,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lords opened up about Depp</a>.</p><p>"I was thinking, 'Would Johnny expect me to be amazing in bed?' What if I wasn't? How could I possibly date anyone, let alone sleep with him, with all this pressure? He climbed into bed next to me and smiled. I was nervous as heck with him so close," the actress wrote.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhwaatdn7ypus2yZJ2doKV6pa3ToqWgZZeev62y0aKcp5yjZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./billie-eilish-uk-tour-ticket-prices.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ticket Prices For Billie Eilish UK Tour Elicits Anger From Fans">&larr;
