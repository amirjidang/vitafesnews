But the tragedy of the late Mexican-American singer's deadly plane crash was clearly the most difficult for the family members she left behind. In a story that almost <a href=#>parallels Aaliyah's devastating death</a>, Jenni died flying home from a performance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only did Jenni have five children when she passed away at age 43, but she also left behind her mother, father, and siblings. But Rivera's death, while tragic, wasn't the end of the family's difficulties.</p><p>Fights over Jenni's estate had fans wondering who wound up with her money and whether her mother Rosa Amelia Saavedra ever got anything.</p><h2 id=is-rosa-saavedra-still-married>Is Rosa Saavedra Still Married?</h2><p>One of the things Jenni's fans are curious about is whether her mom is still married. Rosa wed Jenni's dad, Pedro Rivera, all the way back in 1963. Pedro, who was quite famous on his own long before Jenni made the Rivera name globally famous, divorced his former wife in 2008.</p><p>Today, Pedro Rivera is married to Juana Ahumada, though he has kept their relationship largely under wraps since they married in 2019.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pedro, who owns a record company, is worth an estimated $4M, according to various sources, but there's no word on whether his ex-wife received any cash following their split. In fact, some sources say that Rosa has a literally zero-dollar net worth.</p><p>So what happened to Rosa Saavedra after her divorce, and where is she now?</p><h2 id=what-happened-to-rosa-saavedra>What Happened To Rosa Saavedra?</h2><p>Unfortunately, things haven't been easy for Rosa since Jenni's passing in 2012. In fact, in 2013, Mamas Latinas<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> that unexplained pain led Rosa Saavedra to see her doctor, where she found out there were lumps on her vocal cords.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the time, she didn't know whether it was cancer or not but had hopes that it wasn't. This reminded fans of the time when Jenni found lumps in her breast tissue, only a year before her death.</p><p>Ultimately, sources reported that Rosa did have cancer, but that she later made a full recovery.</p><h2 id=where-are-jenni-rivera-39-s-kids-now>Where Are Jenni Rivera's Kids Now?</h2><p>Of Jenni's five children, most have remained somewhat in the spotlight over the years. Her son <a href=#>Michael Marin Rivera is an artist</a>, while her daughter Chiquis has quite literally followed in her mother's footsteps, performing her mom's songs in tributes, plus her own original music.</p><p>Her children remain close to one another, despite the rumblings and rumors about their relationship and their shared inheritance. They also seem to still be close to their grandmother, who is reportedly somewhat involved in the distribution of Jenni's estate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-got-jenni-rivera-39-s-money>Who Got Jenni Rivera's Money?</h2><p>Though plenty of publications speculate about where Jenni Rivera's estate wound up, it's unclear just who inherited her money. After all, rumors of a falling out with her daughter Chiquis suggested that the famed singer's daughter wouldn't receive a single penny from her mom's estate.</p><p>Those rumors stem from a suggestion that Chiquis was involved with her mother's ex-husband (Esteban Loaiza) at some point. Though at the time of her passing, Jenni was dating Fernando Ramirez, she apparently remained legally married to Loaiza.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's Who Inherited Bob Ross' Estate, And Where They Are Now</a></span></p><p>The mother-daughter falling out preceded Jenni's death by some time, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sources say</a> that Jenni only removed Chiquis from her will a week or two before the fated plane crash. Upon her passing, Rivera's wealth went into a trust for her other four children. The trust was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly managed</a> by her sister, Rosie Rivera.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But earlier this year, Jenni's youngest son Jhonny claimed he had never received any of his mother's money. At the same time, other sources stated that Jenni's mother was part of the discussions over her daughter's estate.</p><p>Both Jenni's mother and her father reportedly engaged in discussions over the late singer's trust. And while Jenni disinherited her daughter, Chiquis' siblings reportedly feel that she deserves part of their mother's wealth.</p><h2 id=what-happened-with-the-rivera-family>What Happened With The Rivera Family?</h2><p>The family has had plenty more drama since Jenni's passing, though. Recently, in fact, Rosa Saavedra <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">spoke out</a> about the allegations against her sister, who is alleged to have acted inappropriately toward her great-niece.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Saavedra seemed reluctant to give the rumors any power, and instead stated that while the accusations didn't surprise her, she didn't think that it was her place to talk about it. Yet she elaborated that she isn't on good terms with her sister, and doesn't have any plans to be.</p><p>Aunt Pita, who is reportedly gay, spoke up to defend herself, but the damage has already been done, according to fans of the Rivera family.</p><p>While Jenni's mother's interview took place while she was taking flowers to her late daughter's grave, fans thought that it was time to leave the family in peace.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Years After Jenni Rivera's Funeral, Some Fans Think She's Still Alive</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdn7KvushmqaKulaeutHnMqKRmqp%2Borm6tzJ6jopldqK6iwsSdqZpll5rBbrnOp5yyZZanvK55xKyrmqyVZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jojo-hannha-montana-audition-offered-role-net-worth-now.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Did JoJo Give Up Tens Of Millions Of Dollars By Turning Down Hannah Montana And Taking Her Career In">&larr;
