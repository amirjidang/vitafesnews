In fact, by the time they met, he already had a healthy net worth of his own. He is a rock star of sorts, after all, and something of a bad boy compared to Cameron.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though Cameron retired from acting a few years ago, she's pursued other ventures that have continued to build her net worth.</p><p>As for Benji, his claim to fame is more obscure than Cameron's trajectory. Yet sources suggest he's worth about $40 million these days. It doesn't sound like much <a href=#>compared to Cameron Diaz's $140 million</a>, especially when she's made the equivalent of Madden's net worth from one single project.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's How Cameron Diaz Made Over $40 Million For 'Bad Teachers'</a></span></p><p>But there are a few reasons Madden's earnings are so impressive.</p><p>For one thing, <a href=#>Benji used to trail behind his brother Joel Madden's net worth</a>, even though the two rose to fame together in the band Good Charlotte. But now, Benji is worth nearly double what his brother is, and fans can't figure out why.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-does-benji-madden-do-for-a-living>What Does Benji Madden Do For A Living?</h2><p>Both twins are still active as the band Good Charlotte, and they've released an impressive seven studio albums and a ton of other projects too. Though they haven't officially disbanded, the last full album the pair released with their bandmates was in 2018 (though they did release a new song in 2020).</p><p>And fans can guess that Benji will be taking some more time away from artistic pursuits now that he and Cameron have their little girl. Joel, of course, has two children with Nicole Richie, so it's clear that the guys make their families a priority.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Cameron Diaz And Benji Madden Welcome A Baby Girl!</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They still pursue plenty of professional opportunities, though, and there are a few ways to explain Benji's earnings over the years. First off, he holds the title of singer and guitarist, of course, but he's also a record producer and CEO.</p><h2 id=benji-and-joel-madden-own-a-company>Benji And Joel Madden Own A Company</h2><p>Benji Madden is the CEO of the twins' company, MDDN, which is an artist management company. The twins apparently work on publishing and production and have worked with various (and somewhat lesser-known) artists like Zakk Cervini, Poppy, and Sleeping with Sirens.</p><p>Though Benji is the CEO of MDDN, the brothers also paired up for other projects as business partners. In a 2020 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a>, Joel Madden chatted about their "digital touring platform" for artists, which is an offshoot of MDDN.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Joel elaborated that the project, which attracted users like Jesse McCartney, Hot Chelle Rae, and Evan Rachel Wood, aims to help artists connect with their fans. The catch is that there's no overhead cost, so artists have management capabilities without commissions.</p><p>The platform, called Veeps, is also a tool that Good Charlotte uses to connect with fans. Even while Joel was homeschooling his kids mid-quarantine and Benji and Cameron were welcoming their quarantine baby, the two were still finding ways to dabble in music -- and boosting their earnings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-else-does-benji-madden-do>What Else Does Benji Madden Do?</h2><p>The catch with Benji's reported net worth -- though many sources disagree over whether he's worth anywhere from $15M to $40M -- is that he doesn't do a lot of visible work. Though he's still active with Good Charlotte, fans kind of wonder how much he's earning from those sources.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>15 Little-Known Facts About Benji Madden's Past (Before Cameron Diaz)</a></span></p><p>If his income really has risen in recent years, by the matter of around $20M, where is that cashflow coming from? It could be that MDDN is just raking in the dough from their various professional projects. But Benji has other interests, too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His Instagram highlights that he's a husband, dad, and brother, but he also states he's a Painter and Maker. Though he tags in MDDNco, Veeps, Good Charlotte, and more, Madden also links to Painted Flowers, a company that appears to sell clothing and jewelry.</p><p>Clearly, Benji's ability to dabble in various pursuits (thanks to his lucrative lot earlier in life) is also helping to grow his net worth. But fans may wonder whether he's also involved in Cameron Diaz's creative pursuits.</p><p>After all, not only has Cameron written two books and been involved in various behind-the-scenes projects adjacent to Hollywood, but she also began producing wine with her own business partner.</p><p>Who knows, maybe Benji and Cameron will embark on some kind of business venture together in the future, possibly once their daughter is a little older. After all, there's plenty of room for more celebrity-owned businesses in the market, and tons of fans would be willing to support a Benji-Cameron venture.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Will Cameron Diaz Ever Add To Her Net Worth By Returning To Hollywood?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZnqaannqurcOdnKdlopq9sL7TnptmbGBiuqq4y6Kmp2WemsFuw86rq6Fn</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./did-lupita-nyongo-want-tchalla-recast-chadwick-boseman.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Lupita Nyongo Really Feels About The MCU's Decision Not To Recast T'Challa">&larr;
