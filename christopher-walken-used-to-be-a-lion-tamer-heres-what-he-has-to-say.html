In a career spanning more than 60 years, Walken has worked in more than 100 movies and has also proved his strong presence as a singer and director. His role as Cpl. Nikanor "Nick" Chevotarevich in the movie “The Deer Hunter” earned him his first Academy Award in the supporting role category.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We thought we knew everything that this man could pull off, but his life before fame has many interesting chapters that we may not be aware of.</p><h2 id=walken-has-a-ton-of-working-experience>Walken Has A Ton Of Working Experience</h2><p>Walken’s path to becoming a successful Hollywood actor passes through a number of different show business careers. Before moving on to stage roles and films, he worked as a dancer in a cabaret nightclub, having trained as a dancer at Washington Dance Club.</p><p>Additionally, to make money, Walken tried his hands on many seasonal jobs. One of those jobs was as an assistant <a href=#>lion tamer in a circus</a>. Chris is fond of animals... particularly, cats.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Lord Voldemort: 20 Unnerving Secrets About His Past</a></span></p><h2 id=what-walken-has-to-say-about-his-lion-taming-experience>What Walken Has To Say About His Lion Taming Experience</h2><p>Christopher Walken’s “king of the jungle speech” quite defines what he has learned working as a lion tamer. “They're barking at him, laughing at him. But every once in a while, the lion has to show the jackals who he is”, says Mike (Christopher Walken) from Poolhall Junkies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When asked how he got into Lion Taming, Chris said he saw the job in a trade paper, and that’s how he got most of his work those days. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Chris highlights his experience of working as a lion Tamer, saying, “When he [Head Tamer] would finish his act, there would be one lion left, and I used to go in with the whip and have this lion do tricks. It was a female lion named Sheba, and she was very sweet. Like a dog, really. I would wave the whip, and she would run and sit up and roll over and do things.”</p><p>In contrast, he finds the flip side of the experience&nbsp;allowed him to notice&nbsp;that the act was fake and unnecessary. However, Chris cherishes all of his memories with his favorite old lioness, Sheba.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=christopher-walken-s-idea-of-working>Christopher Walken’s Idea Of Working</h2><p>Christopher Walken’s persona, driven by his unconventional yet charming style, has reached an iconic level. He doesn’t like to turn down offers to work and he has a relevant explanation for why; he says he doesn’t have any kids, no hobbies, and he doesn’t even like to travel. The work he does is the only thing he's into.</p><p><span class=next-single>Congratulations to Walken and his work.
