Following the news of their split, the two sides tried their best to reach a settlement, but things dragged on for months.

Her background is rooted in fashion; she worked as a handbag designer for renowned luxury brands.</p><p>"Costner was still married to his first wife, Cindy Silva, when he originally met Baumgartner. The two crossed paths on a golf course where Costner was rehearsing for his 1996 romantic comedy Tin Cup," People reports.</p><p>The couple tied the knot in 2004, in a beautiful ceremony held at Costner's ranch in Aspen, Colorado.</p><p>In total, the duo had three children together, making a total of 7 for Costner.</p><p>Sadly, things were not meant to last, and their marriage eventually fractured.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ariana-grande-s-divorce-settlement-bans-the-release-of-images-from-her-marriage-to-dalton-gomez-for-this-reason.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Ariana Grande's Divorce Settlement Bans The Release Of Images From Her Marriage To Dalton Gomez For This Reason">Ariana Grande's Divorce Settlement Bans The Release Of Images From Her Marriage To Dalton Gomez For This Reason</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Ariana Grande and Dalton Gomez's divorce settlement includes a fascinating rule...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=christine-baumgartner-requested-more-than-was-initially-ordered-but-received-much-less-than-expected>Christine Baumgartner Requested More Than Was Initially Ordered, But Received Much Less Than Expected</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar49148587.jpg><p>It had been widely reported that Baumgartner filed for divorce in May.</p><p>Following the filing, Costner's publicist said, "It is with great sadness that circumstances beyond his control have transpired which have resulted in Mr. Costner having to participate in a dissolution of marriage."</p><p>During the divorce settlement, Baumgartner asked for a specific amount of money, but sadly, she was not able to get what she asked for.</p><p>"The two had already fought in court over child support payments.

We tried to negotiate, they offered me less money than previous seasons, there were issues with the creative … we came up with a number, and they [Yellowstone] walked away. I’ve been told it’s a little disappointing that [it’s] the #1 show on TV [and] I’m not participating," the actor said.</p><p>Mind you, Costner was making a total of $24 million for season 5, which is broken up into 2 parts, so it's not like he was exactly strapped for cash, or making a tiny amount.</p><p>In response, series creator, Taylor Sheridan, said, "My opinion of Kevin as an actor hasn’t altered. His creation of John Dutton is symbolic and powerful … and I’ve never had an issue with Kevin that he and I couldn’t work out on the phone. But once lawyers get involved, then people don’t get to talk to each other and start saying things that aren’t true and attempt to shift blame based on how the press or public seem to be reacting."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Per his IMDb, Costner is attached to two Horizon projects as an actor.
