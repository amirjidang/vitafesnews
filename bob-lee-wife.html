In 2022, the app had 51 million monthly active users, and 13 million people had a Cash Card in 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, Square wants Cash App to be more than a simple payment tool and aims for it to be a hub for all financial interests.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Wife, age & career</h2><p>Lee was a tech industry veteran who invested in companies such as SpaceX, Clubhouse, and Figma.&nbsp;</p><p>He worked as an open-source developer for ten years in St. Louis before moving to San Francisco and working as an engineer at Google, where he assisted with setting up the core library for the development of the Android operating system.&nbsp;</p><p>Lee was also involved in fundraising efforts, and in 2009, he swam from Alcatraz to San Francisco to raise funds for the American Liver Foundation.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vizaca.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bob-Lee-683x1024.jpg><p>After five years at Google, Lee was hired by Square to develop its Android app. He later became the companyâ€™s first CTO and left in 2014 to become an advisor for startups and an <a href=#>angel investor</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2015, he became CEO of the local chat group app Present, and in 2018, he invested in his current company, MobileCoin, which later received $66 million in venture backing.</p><p>Lee hoped that MobileCoin could democratize access to digital cash for the unbanked worldwide.</p><p>Leeâ€™s <a href=#>social media</a> accounts showed glimpses of his personal and professional life, including his love for coffee and his travels to various tech events and festivals.&nbsp;</p><p>Bob Lee got married to an American woman named Krista, but the couple parted ways.&nbsp;</p><p>Bob Lee wife, Krista nÃ©e Drake, lived with him in San Francisco with their two children before their separation.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Bob Lee net worth</h2><p>Before his untimely death, Bob Lee had an estimated net worth of $10 million, largely due to his involvement in various companies throughout his career, including being the creator of the successful Cash App.&nbsp;</p><p>Market Realist reported his net worth to be around $10 million.&nbsp;</p><p>The app had 44 million verified monthly users in 2019, generating profits of $1.8 billion, according to Reuters.
