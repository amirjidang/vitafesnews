He has been posting movies and short films to his YouTube page since he was 14 years old. Following his breakthrough debut performance on MTV's Teen Wolf, he was offered a number of other roles. The actor is most recognized for his part in The Maze Runner, a sci-fi adventure series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since the announcement of Paramount+'s impending wolf film in September 2021, followers of the supernatural tv series had expected several of the series' regular stars to return. That is why many people were upset when actor Dylan O'Brien was not mentioned among the cast members.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Twitter Reacts To Dylan O'Brien Going Platinum Blonde For His New Movie And We’re 'Not Okay’">Twitter Reacts To Dylan O'Brien Going Platinum Blonde For His New Movie And We’re 'Not Okay’</a></span></p><p>It sparked a lot of suspicion among fans, who wondered why the beloved face of the show isn't reprising her role as Stiles. For the first six seasons of Teen Wolf, he was a regular, with cameos in the seventh season. So why isn't Dylan returning for the new film?</p><h2 id=dylan-o-39-brien-and-his-role-in-39-teen-wolf-39>Dylan O'Brien And His Role In 'Teen Wolf'</h2><p>Among the amiss members on the "Teen Wolf: The Movie" ensemble lineup, O'Brien is possibly the most striking. O'Brien rose to prominence while portraying Stiles Stilinski, Tyler Posey's childhood best friend, on MTV's blockbuster drama from 2011 to 2017, and quickly established himself as a star among the actors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>O'Brien has always professed gratitude for his breakthrough project, and the reason that he participated in the seventh season's last segments at all was proof of it.</p><p>O'Brien rose to popularity beyond the "Teen Wolf" program during the course of the show, featuring in the famous Maze Runner series. After a major on-set injury stalled filming, he had to take a break from shooting Teen Wolf last season to make available for the third part of Maze Runner.</p><p>"I wasn't initially able to be a part of the last 10 [episodes] at all, nor was I scheduled to be," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he told Entertainment Tonight in 2017</a>, adding that returning to bid Stiles farewell was a totally voluntary choice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Is What Really Happened To Dylan O'Brien's Ex-Girlfriend, Britt Robertson</a></span></p><h2 id=dylan-o-39-brien-isn-39-t-listed-as-a-cast-member-on-39-teen-wolf-39>Dylan O'Brien Isn't Listed As A Cast Member On 'Teen Wolf'</h2><p><a href=#>Tyler Posey and Dylan O'Brien, both Teen Wolf stars, are still friends</a>, but one is in the star cast, while the other isn't. Holland Roden, Tyler Posey, Shelley Hennig, Orny Adams, Crystal Reed, JR Bourne, Lindy Ashby, Colton Haynes, Seth Gilliam, Melissa Ponzio, Ryan Kelley, and Dylan Sprayberry are among the cast stars appearing for the Paramount+ film.</p><p>Dylan O'Brien will not be reprising his role as Teen Wolf in the new Paramount+ film, and the star has stated why he took the tough decision to leave the revival.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Arden Cho and Tyler Hoechlin also aren't on the lineup of returning cast actors, which may have piqued the interest of die-hard Teen Wolf fans. After the fourth season, Hoechlin went from a regular cast member to a celebrity guest, while Cho was written off the series at the end of the fifth season.</p><p>As per Deadline, Paramount+ will reveal more cast additions shortly, and Hoechlin is expected to be one of the next group of the guaranteed returning cast.</p><p>The revival picture is set to hit theaters in late 2022.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Hackers Have Been Messing With Dylan O'Brien And Britt Robertson's Private Lives For Years</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-won-39-t-dylan-o-39-brien-be-in-the-new-39-teen-wolf-39-movie>Why Won't Dylan O'Brien Be In The New 'Teen Wolf' Movie?</h2><p>"I haven't heard anything about this, but I can assure you I probably won't be in it," O'Brien said when questioned if he'd be willing to appear in any subsequent Teen Wolf spinoffs or installments. So it's no shocker that O'Brien will not appear in the "Teen Wolf" film reboot. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In an interview with Variety, he discussed</a> his choice not to join the picture, adding, "It was a difficult decision."</p><p>"The show has a special place in my heart. It was the very first job I ever did, and many of the people I met there are very close to me. I was trying to make it work, but it all happened really quickly," the actor noted.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We weren't aware that it was taking place, and they just threw it at us, which was OK because we all enjoy the show. We were trying to figure out what was going on. Finally, I determined that it was left in an excellent location for me and that I would like to keep it there. I wish them luck, and I'll be watching it the first night it's out. I'm not going to be in it, but I wish it f***ing kicks a*s."</p><p>However, when the actor was questioned about a prospective Teen Wolf reunion during a special interview on Variety's The Big Ticket talk show for the promotion of his new movie Love and Monsters, <a href=#>Dylan O'Brien revealed that he is open to a Teen Wolf reunion</a> and encouraged fans that one would eventually happen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I would take any opportunity to accomplish anything," O'Brien stated. "At some point, we'll get back together for something."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Why Fans Think Dylan O'Brien Was Secretly Dating Sarah Ramos</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdrLyvwIydsKWZnmK8o77InqVmmpVitq95zZ6uZqyVmrtuw86lnWaln6u2pns%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./richest-poker-players-celeb.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Erik Seidel Net Worth | TheRichest">&larr;
