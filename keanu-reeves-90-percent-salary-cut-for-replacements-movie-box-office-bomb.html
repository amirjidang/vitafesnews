From <a href=#>turning down big-budget projects</a> in favor of little-known indie films to donating chunks of his fortune to charitable causes, Reeves stands out as one of the most magnanimous Hollywood stars out there.</p><p>Among his lesser-known benevolent gestures is hacking off a whopping 90% from his salary in the 2000s sports comedy, The Replacements, solely so the studio could afford to hire Gene Hackman in a supporting role. However, unlike <a href=#>Devil's Advocate, another film in which Reeves pulled a similar nice-guy stunt</a>, The Replacements struggled to break even, scraping together a mere $100K in box office profits against its colossal $50 million budget. So, did Reeves regret working for a fraction of his worth, given the film’s lackluster box office performance?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=keanu-reeves-took-a-90-percent-pay-cut-to-star-in-the-replacements>Keanu Reeves Took A 90 Percent Pay Cut To Star In The Replacements</h2><p>Keanu Reeves currently ranks among the most bankable stars in Hollywood, with his latest box office masterpiece, John Wick: Chapter Four, raking in a staggering $432.2 million against a $100 million budget.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/keanu-reeves-and-gene-hackman.jpg><p>But the box office hasn't always been so kind to Keanu. In the late 1990s, the now 58-year-old experienced a bit of a downturn in his career, starring in a slew of tepidly received films, including Johnny Mnemonic, Chain Reaction, and Feeling Minnesota.</p><p>It was right around this time that Reeves took on the lead role in Howard Deutch's sports comedy, The Replacements. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to the New York Post</a>, the John Wick star was offered a whopping $12 million to star in the film; an amount nearly a quarter of the film's budget.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, things weren't panning out quite as well for two-time Academy Award winner Gene Hackman, whose supporting role in the film was still hanging in the balance due to budget concerns.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Keanu Reeves Was Sued For $3 Million A Month After A Canadian Woman Claimed He Was The Father Of Her Kids</a></span></p><p>Eager to work with the acclaimed actor, Reeves went ahead and pulled yet another legendary nice-guy stunt; giving up a staggering 90 percent of his salary just so Warner Bros. Pictures could afford Hackman's salary.</p><h2 id=the-replacements-ended-up-making-just-100k-in-box-office-profits>The Replacements Ended Up Making Just $100K In Box Office Profits</h2><p>Despite Keanu Reeves' valiant sacrifice, The Replacements didn't exactly make a killing at the box office. Despite debuting in the third position at the North American box office, the film went on to gross a measly $50.1 million globally, barely recouping its $50 million budget.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/keanu-reeves.jpg><p>The film didn't dazzle on the critical front either. Esteemed film critic <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Roger Ebert gave the film a mere two stars out of five</a>, chastising both its cliché premise and overstated plot.</p><p>“The Replacements is slap-happy entertainment painted in broad strokes, two coats thick,” he wrote. “It's like a standard sports movie, but with every point made twice or three times--as if we'd never seen one before. And the musical score provides such painstaking instructions about how to feel during every scene, it's like the booklet that tells you how to unpack your computer.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Keanu Reeves Refuses To Star In A Film With Tom Cruise As An Adversary</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While also unimpressed with the premise, Entertainment Weekly's Lisa Schwarzbaum went a step further and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">questioned Reeves' suitability for the lead role</a>.</p><p>“I’m charmed that Reeves, with his alt-rocker physique and Zen-adept’s impassive face, chose to follow up his cult-hit success as someone who’s all brain in The Matrix by clamping a helmet over his soft, floppy, Pantene-shiny hair and rushing the field as someone who’s supposed to be all body,” she wrote at the time. “The casting is weird and counterintuitive, bordering on preposterous, but I don’t mind; it may suggest a perception glitch on the star’s part to think this is a role he’s in fact suited for, but I prefer to think of him as…unfazed.”</p><h2 id=did-keanu-reeves-regret-taking-a-90-percent-pay-cut-to-star-in-the-replacements>Did Keanu Reeves Regret Taking A 90 Percent Pay Cut To Star In The Replacements?</h2><p>Despite its lackluster box office performance, Keanu Reeves had nothing but good things to say about The Replacements.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Even though it jumps into cliché – like, there’s the underdog team, the misfits, there’s a bar fight, the girl and the guy looking at each other and falling in love, with the swooning – when I was watching everyone do their performances, I didn’t think they were just effects,” he shared with the New York Post. “I felt like each one was a person, and that the comedy was coming out of the humanity.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/keanu-reeves-looking-sad.jpg><p>Moreover, the John Wick star didn't harbor any regrets about working for scale in the film, as is evident <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">from his 2008 interview with Total Film (UK)</a>, where he spoke candidly about slashing his salary for the film and relinquishing $2 million for Devil's Advocate, all in the pursuit of sharing the screen with Gene Hackman and Al Pacino, respectively.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“[Gene Hackman] and I had lighter, much lighter, scenes to do,” he said. “But to hang out with him and to see how - both actors - just see how they go about their craft... They're both such beautiful actors. We don't think of Al Pacino now with economy, but that's what he has. He's just a beautiful actor and Gene Hackman is another nonpareil, you know?”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Keanu Reeves' Reaction To Sandra Bullock Interrupting His Speed Interview Is Everything We Hoped It Would Be</a></span></p><p>As for why losing such a colossal chunk of money didn’t faze him, Reeves admitted to New York Post. “For me, I guess I don’t connect the enjoyment and the money. I work on a part and hopefully realize a part, and make good films. Some of the successes I’ve had I’m grateful for, because it creates other opportunities. [The way] I look at it is I get to act again.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiinpmeqnqzscSvnKxlaWV6sbHRnJynrF2orq2t0bJknK2kYrOwvoyrnKmkkZiyrrHNrapmpZ%2BrtqZ5waivZqeWm7aksYybpqaaXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ken-weatherwax-pugsley-from-the-addams-family-dies-at-59-2014912.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ken Weatherwax, Pugsley from The Addams Family, Dies at 59">&larr;
