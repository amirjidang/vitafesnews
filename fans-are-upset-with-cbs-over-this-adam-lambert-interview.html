Not only did he dominate his season of American Idol, placing in second, but the rocker has since gone on to become the lead for the iconic group, Queen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The star has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">been up to a lot since his time on Idol,</a> however, it appears as if a 2009 CBS interview with Lambert is what's on everyone's mind. Following <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lil Nas X</a>'s recent BET performance, where he kisses his backup dancer, viewers were very divided over the "controversial" moment.</p><p>Fans immediately recalled a similar incident happening to Adam Lambert during the American Music Awards, where he too, also shares a kiss on-stage. Well, turns out, fans aren't happy with how that interview turned out, and here's why!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>9 Singers You Forgot Auditioned For 'American Idol' (And Made It Big)</a></span></p><h2 id=adam-lambert-s-2009-ama-s-performance>Adam Lambert's 2009 AMA's Performance</h2><p>Adam Lambert has become a household name since his start on the hit talent series, American Idol back in 2009.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The rocker, who is known for his continued work with the LGBTQ+ community, joined the show back in its eighth season and while he may have lost the winning title to Kris Allen at the time, it's clear that Lambert's career didn't take a single hit for placing second.</p><p>Although him being runner-up actually did wonders for his career, a 2009 performance of Adam's at the American Music Awards caused quite the stir, one that continues to appear to be an issue 12 years later!</p><p>During his AMA performance, Adam sang his hit song, 'For Your Entertainment', and following the lyric "can you handle what I'm about to do?" <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adam leaned in to kiss the keyboardist</a>, a moment that Adam claims impacted his career immensely.</p><p>The singer faced backlash for his performance, despite a same-sex kiss having happened years before with Britney Spears, Madonna, and Christina Aguilera at the 2003 MTV VMA's.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The singer revealed he was later "pulled off of ABC for a little while" and even had his Good Morning America segment the day after his AMA performance canceled.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>What Really Happened Between Adam Lambert And Ex, Javi Costa Polo?</a></span></p><h2 id=the-early-show-interview>'The Early Show' Interview</h2><p>Adam was later re-scheduled for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a different morning talk show</a>, The Early Show on CBS where they agreed to allow Adam to appear and perform, so long as they could do a one-on-one interview regarding the controversial performance.</p><p>It was then that Adam knew that there was a huge "double standard" when it came to same-sex kissing. After The Early Show host, Maggie Rodriguez touched on the Britney x Madonna x Christina kiss, the network played the clip, without any censorship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They later played Adam's performance, and blurred out the kiss, making it clear that the issue was not the kiss, but the fact that it was between two men.</p><p>"I just remember thinking that was the biggest slap in the face," Lambert said. "Two women kissing was not indecent, but two men kissing was."</p><p>The CBS interview with Adam re-surfaced following Lil Nax X's recent performance at the BET Awards; where he sang his hit song, 'Montera (Call Me By Your Name)'.</p><p>During his set, Lil Nas X, much like Adam back in 2009, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">kissed one of his backup dancers.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The moment led to a very divided response amongst viewers, however, Adam Lambert thought it was everything! The rock star brought up his moments 12 years ago, and how jarring it is that this remains an issue not just within the music industry, but at all!</p><p>While it's clear the "double standard" is very much alive and well, the Adam Lamberts and Lil Nas X's of the world will continue to push boundaries, setting a new precedent where an on-stage kiss doesn't make headlines news.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>The LGBTQ Community Is Outraged As Fans Troll Diddy's Comment To Lil Nas X</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidmqajYq6zsYyup6ydpGLEqsDHZpqbq12kw6a%2BjK2foqtdlrGiuYylmKaalafBbrXNrZyrrpmaxHA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./gangsta-boo-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gangsta Boo Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr;
