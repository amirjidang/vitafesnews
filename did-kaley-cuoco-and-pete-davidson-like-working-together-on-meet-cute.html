Since then, the two stars have gone on to pursue a myriad of other projects. Of couse, this includes the film Meet Cute, which is far from a typical romantic comedy.The film tells a story of a woman named Sheila (Cuoco) who keeps returning 24 hours into the past as she’s determined to transform a guy she likes (Davidson) into the perfect partner. Their scenes together are both funny and heartwarming. And as it turns out, Cuoco and Davidson’s performances together were also very heartfelt.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kaley-cuoco-agreed-to-do-meet-cute-after-pete-davidson-signed-on>Kaley Cuoco Agreed To Do Meet Cute After Pete Davidson Signed On</h2><p>Especially in recent years, Cuoco has been quite particular about the kind of projects she agrees to do. And it seems that Meet Cute was exactly what she was looking for especially after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">learning that Davidson already agreed to do the movie</a>.</p><p>“We’ve seen romantic comedies and time travel; we’ve done all of that. There was something about this that was unique,” Cuoco pointed out. “And when I heard Pete was attached, I was like, ‘This is such an interesting, kind of a different type of film.’ And honestly it’s really sweet, and it brings a lot of joy.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Are Obsessed With Kaley Cuoco and Pete Davidson Goofing Around On The Set Of 'Meet Cute'</a></span></p><p>Meanwhile, for Alex Lehmann, the film’s director, Meet Cute also presented an opportunity to tell a more realistic love story.</p><p>“I respect all the other rom-coms out there and there are some great ones. It’s not really my genre that I would see myself in, but it felt like I got to tell a really honest one even though there was a tanning bed time machine in it,” he said.</p><p>“We got to play with real characters. There was a lot of freedom where it felt like if I was going to make a rom-com, this is it.”</p><p>Moreover, for Lehmann, there was also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">no other actor suited for the male lead role better than Davidson</a>.</p><p>“I didn’t have a full vision of how Gary worked on the page. Casting Pete really unlocked it for me," he revealed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Because you want to save Pete Davidson, but he keeps you laughing so much that you kind of forget that you want to save him. That’s the trade-off that I think keeps Sheila so obsessive about him. So that made a ton of sense.”</p><h2 id=pete-davidson-and-kaley-cuoco-showed-lsquo-so-much-of-their-authenticity-rsquo-in-meet-cute>Pete Davidson And Kaley Cuoco Showed ‘So Much Of Their Authenticity’ In Meet Cute</h2><p>Cuoco and Davidson may have never worked together prior to Meet Cute but onscreen, their chemistry was so evident. And impressively, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the two stars didn’t even have to rehearse their scenes</a> to nail them.</p><p>“We didn't have a ton of time to rehearse… so we actually didn't rehearse at all,” Lehmann explained. “Instead, we spent that extra time getting to know each other and getting comfortable with each other.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Less Than A Year After Karl Cook Split, Kaley Cuoco Says Her Life Is "Just Starting" With New Boyfriend</a></span></p><p>At the same time, both stars also connected with their characters at such a deeply personal level that it showed onscreen. “There's a big piece of the real Pete and the real Kaley in the film, and a big piece of the real me behind the camera,” the director further said.</p><p>“I was really fortunate to be able to see so much of their authenticity come through. That isn't something that always happens in a film. It requires trust, both me trusting them and them trusting me.”</p><h2 id=there-were-also-a-lot-of-jokes-and-improv-between-the-stars-on-set>There Were Also A Lot Of Jokes And Improv Between The Stars On Set</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With both stars coming from a comedy background, jokes did persist on set, as fans may have expected. At times, it may have even interfered with filming just a little bit.</p><p>“We were on a really tight shooting schedule, and so it was very inconvenient how much they were making us laugh,” Lehmann joked.</p><p>“It was very funny, and like thank you for the front row seats to the Pete Davidson Kaley Cuoco show… their chemistry was fantastic. They’re just two really driven people who ultimately want to play, and so they worked really hard to set up playgrounds for themselves.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Bodies Bodies Bodies Director 'Immediately Knew' Pete Davidson Should Be In The Movie</a></span></p><p>At the same time, there were also some notable improv moments in the movie, such as when Davidson did “like five minutes on Jaws, and then another five minutes on the end of Titanic, and you’re just like, ‘This is great.’” Lehmann also added, “Gary feels real because Pete’s not making this guy up, he’s actually Gary.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meanwhile, aside from Meet Cute, fans can also look forward to seeing Davidson in <a href=#>his upcoming comedy series Bupkis</a> where the comedian will play a fictionalized version of himself. Davidson also has several other film projects in the works too.</p><p>As for Cuoco, she stars in the upcoming thriller Role Play with Connie Nielsen, Bill Nighy, and David Oyelowo. She might also start work on <a href=#>season 3 of The Flight Attendant</a> soon enough but for now, that is unconfirmed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdoK6tsdhmmq6nk6R6orrDZqeerJVisaLCyJ2qqKZdobassYywpqujmaO0bsDOoJytoJWnerC6jKacnqxdmMK1sY4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kelly-ogrady-bio-wiki-age-height-family-husband-fox-news-salary-and-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kelly OGrady Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Family, Husband, Fox News, Salary, and Net Worth">&larr;
