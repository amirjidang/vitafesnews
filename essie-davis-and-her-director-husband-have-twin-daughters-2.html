Justin Kurzel started his career in 2005 with Blue Tongue.</p><p>The Australian actress made waves as Phryne Fisher in Miss Fisher’s Murder Mysteries and remains one of the finest performers to grace the stage. But her time on the silver screen is far from over, as she recently expressed her desire to win an Oscar.</p><p>Besides, she had a CV to back up her claim, with The Babadook being one of the best horror films of the past decade. Not to mention blockbusters like Game of Thrones and Lambs of God are just two of many acting credits.</p><p>Indeed, she is never free, with new projects in development in Australia, New Zealand, and England. But the most exciting work was in The Murmuring, which she made with previous collaborator Jennifer Kent.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=justin-kurzel-is-a-film-director></span>Justin Kurzel Is A Film Director<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Essie Davis and her husband&nbsp;Justin Kurzel&nbsp;have been together as a couple since 2002. Justin Kurzel shares twins daughters with his soulmate.</p><p>The film director and screenwriter is a son of immigrant roots, with his father fleeing from Poland and his mother cruising from Malta.</p><p>Even his younger brother Jed Kurzel had a knack for artistry as he is a blues rock musician. He had gained recognition for writing the music score for his elder sibling’s projects.</p><p>Everything shifted when he met the love of his life in 1996 during a play. He knew he had fallen for life as they began dating soon after. Their busy schedules kept them apart until they finally tied the knot in 2002.</p><p>It was a matter of time before they had children, as they had twin daughters, Ruby and Stella.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=he-debuted-with-blue-tongue></span>He Debuted With Blue Tongue<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Despite being in the business since 2001, Kurzel did not make his debut until 2004, when he directed Blue Tongue.</p><p>But his first feature film came years later when he worked on Snowtown, winning him the AACTA Award for Best Direction. The brutality and violence were not everyone’s cup of tea, but the critics had no faults in his leadership, calling it a demonstration of strength and patience.</p><p>In 2015 came his film adaptation of William Shakespeare’s Macbeth, scoring him a spot at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival. He has also dabbled in the video games genre, directing the infamous Assassin’s Creed franchise.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=kurzel-has-worked-with-his-wife></span>Kurzel Has Worked With His Wife<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>When searching for the perfect actress, Kurzel had to look no further than his home, as his wife was the best performer.</p><p>The 2022 Nitram told about the life and behaviors of a mentally distressed young man of the same name that starred Caleb Landry Jones and Judy Davis. Essie played Helen, his neighbor whom he lost in a car crash that he caused.</p><p>Although she was in a supporting role, her convincing emotions made the audience believe her to be someone who could compel the lead actor to get cornered into depression.</p><p>The previous year, they also worked together in True&nbsp;History of the Kelly Gang, a project based on the 2000 novel of the same name by Peter Carey.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-essie-and-justin-have-children></span>Do Essie And Justin Have Children?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Essie and Justin are proud parents to two children, as they have twins daughters. The couple is protective of their kids.</p><p>It’s safe to assume that the celebrity pair are living a highly publicized life with every emotion camera ready. The inner workings of their minds get exposed and sacrificed for art’s sake, as it’s only natural for them not to want the same for their kiddies.</p><p>So, she has consciously settled to keep their identities hidden and not share a picture till they are of consenting age.</p><p>But Davis does not shy away from deriving inspiration from the twins as she has played a mother multiple times on the screen. People cannot forget her convincing work as Bunny King in The Justice of Bunny King.</p><p>The Gaysorn Thavat-directed movie told the story of a mother of two with a sharp tongue and a turbulent past. She battles the system to take guardianship of her niece Tonya while the world stands against her.</p><p>The project was close to her heart as she is a mother of two. She could relate to the temperament, with the critics giving the flick a 95 percent on Rotton Tomatoes solely based on her craft.</p><p>Besides, she understands the dilemma of not having enough to eat. Her dad was desperate for other income sources with seven mouths to feed as her brother took a job to help him.</p><p>Amidst the chaos, he taught her the basics of arts and crafts and supported her in assembling an outlet when life became too stressful.</p><p>Then time went by at the speed of light as she enrolled at the University of Tasmania and graduated from the&nbsp;National Institute of Dramatic Art.</p><p>Although she had been interested in theatricals since high school, her performance only blossomed when she joined college, being well-versed in Shakespeare, Sheridan, and Stoppard.</p><p>She had the lead role in the 1993s Romeo and Juliet while also starring in other Shakespearean retellings of Hamlet, Richard 3, and Macbeth during her time at the Bell Shakespeare.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJ2jqLamecOaraKrXZa7pXnHnqlmnJmnsqTAzqtkoa2jl66vsIyhmK%2BdXanEqrqMnZiun5ipsrO%2FjGtm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./foxy-brown-calls-keith-murray-crackhead-1234727020.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Foxy Brown Calls Keith Murray A &amp;quot;Crackhead&amp;quot; After Sexual Claims">&larr;
