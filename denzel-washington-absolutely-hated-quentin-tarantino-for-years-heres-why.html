After all, Tarantino is often considered to be among the most powerful filmmakers in the world and <a href=#>when Washington isn’t impressed with an actor</a>, that kind of thing gets out in the press.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, there are a few people in Hollywood who can afford to have a powerful enemy including Denzel Washington and Quentin Tarantino. With that in mind, it is pretty amusing that for many years Tarantino was very angry with Washington. Clearly, that begs an obvious question, why was Tarantino mad at Washington for so long?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Thing About Brad Pitt Deeply Annoys Quentin Tarantino</a></span></p><h2 id=tarantino-rsquo-s-other-credits>Tarantino’s Other Credits</h2><p>Ever since the early-90s, Quentin Tarantino has been one of the most celebrated filmmakers in the world. The reason for that is that Tarantino has directed a long list of beloved movies including Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Inglourious Basterds, and Django Unchained among others.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, most movie fans know that in addition to Quentin Tarantino’s directing credits, he wrote the scripts for all of his famous films. In fact, people love his style so much that a lot is known about <a href=#>how Tarantino writes his movies</a> and many of his peers try to imitate his technique. Even though his writing is so acclaimed, a lot of his fans have no idea that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tarantino has worked on the scripts of several other films</a>.</p><p>During the early stages of his Hollywood career, Quentin Tarantino was credited with writing the scripts for True Romance and From Duck til Dawn. Tarantino is also credited with coming up with the story for Natural Born Killers and he scripted a segment in the film Four Rooms. On top of all of those films, Tarantino didn’t receive credit for his work on the scripts for movies like It’s Pat, The Rock, and Crimson Tide.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Quentin Tarantino's $120 Million Net Worth And How He Spends It</a></span></p><h2 id=a-long-standing-feud>A Long-Standing Feud</h2><p>Amazingly enough, Quentin Tarantino started a feud with one of the most powerful people in Hollywood due to his work on one of the movies he wasn’t credited for. According to the reports, Tarantino was asked to come in and rework the script for Crimson Tide, a movie that Denzel Washington headlined alongside Gene Hackman. Evidently, the reason Tarantino was hired to work on that film’s script is that someone decided the movie needed some pop culture references.</p><p>According to reports, when Denzel Washington read the results of Quentin Tarantino’s Crimson Tide rewrite, he was very unhappy. The reason for that is that Washington reportedly believed that Tarantino’s added dialogue was racist.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Denzel Washington took offense to the dialogue that Quentin Tarantino wrote</a> for Crimson Tide’s script, he reportedly opted to confront the writer. Of course, nobody likes to be called out and that is especially true when there are other people around. As a result, Tarantino reportedly asked Washington to take their conversation somewhere private but his request was refused. Instead, Washington reportedly replied, “No, if we’re going to discuss it, let’s discuss it now.”</p><p>Of course, the only person who knows why Quentin Tarantino held this interaction against Denzel Washington for years is the powerful director herself. That said, if the reports are accurate, it seems like the real problem Tarantino had with Washington was the humiliation he felt because he was dressed down in front of a group of people.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Julia Roberts And Denzel Washington Have Problems Behind The Scenes?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=burying-the-hatchet>Burying The Hatchet</h2><p>Throughout Quentin Tarantino’s career, he has always been outspoken. As a result, the powerful director has had it out with several stars. However, since Denzel Washington, Tarantino is capable of putting his hard feelings aside as the two men were able to make peace.</p><p>In 2012, Denzel Washington sat down for an interview with GQ. During that conversation, the fact that <a href=#>Washington’s kids have been following in his footsteps</a> came up. The reason for that is Washington’s eldest daughter Katia had taken a job as a crew member and as part of the editorial department on Tarantino’s movie Django Unchained. Once that topic was broached, it was only natural that the interviewer asked <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington about his feud with Tarantino and the famous actor revealed how he’d put an end to it</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I buried that hatchet. I sought him out ten years ago. I told him, ‘Look, I apologize.’ You've just gotta let that go. You gonna walk around with that the rest of your life? He seemed relieved. And then here we are ten years later, and my daughter's working with him. Life is something.”Considering that Crimson Tide came out in 1995 and Washington estimated he buried the hatchet with Tarantino in the early-2000s, Quentin clearly held a grudge for years.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Quentin Tarantino Admits He Refused To Support His Mom After She Insulted His Writing Career</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibnqaqmrluw8Csn6Kml6m8r3nAm6qopKWpsq3FjKGYrZ2UYr62sc2toKdlpJa%2ForrToqWoZZakv27FxJqprGWYmr%2Bmv4ywn7JlXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./nadir-khayat-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Red One Net Worth | TheRichest">&larr;
