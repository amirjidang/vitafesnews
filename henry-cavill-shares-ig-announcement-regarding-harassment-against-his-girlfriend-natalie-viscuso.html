While not all of the response about Cavill being in a relationship was negative, it was easy to see the reactions that leaned towards that feeling.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The price of being famous does include having each diehard fan watching their every move, and Cavill understood that and just casually adapted to the new lifestyle. However, things have gotten toxic for his partner Viscuso as she disabled comments in her post involving her and Cavill playing chess in a romantically lit room.</p><p>Due to the intense responses of Cavill's relationship with Viscuso, he made an announcement on Instagram about the animosity he has been seeing on social media.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Henry Cavill Goes Public With New Girlfriend, And Twitter Users Are Angry</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cavill</a> has disabled comments in his recent post, and when that happens, fans will know that it is very serious. In his announcement, he acknowledges that his fans are deeply passionate about him and what goes on in his personal life. However, while understanding how interesting it can be to know what happens to Cavill, he wrote about the matters from his private life, "I know it can be fun to speculate, to gossip, and to dive into our own personal echo chambers on the internet, but your 'passion' is misplaced, and it causes harm to the people I care about most."</p><p>He would go on to confirm that the negative&nbsp;assumptions are completely false and that he is incredibly happy where he is and with his relationship with Viscuso. Cavill also wishes for his fans to be happy with him or do their best to do their best in general, as he wouldn't have gotten this far as an actor because of them.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Think This Is The Reason Henry Cavill Is Keeping His New Relationship Private</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From the looks of things, Cavill and Viscuso are in a serious relationship and there's nothing that will change unless they grow apart due to the former's busy schedule.&nbsp;The idea of having your favorite celebrity noticing you is an exciting and understandable dream goal. Luckily, there are big Cavill fans that understand this and are rightfully upset and sorry for him having to post the announcement in the first place.</p><p>Being happy for them above everything else is more important than being upset that you're not in a relationship with them.&nbsp;Harassing any celebrity's partner is never okay&nbsp;regardless of how big or small they are in following.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Close Did Henry Cavill Come To Quitting Acting?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqairnqkrdWio6Vlo52us7HSZqCgZZGju7DBzZycpp2eqXqzscaaqZ2hnpx6qa3RmqqspZWjwW6txpqgp6ukYrWqv4ygoKuklqe2prrDZqWarJGhtqZ51aKqnK2jpHw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-charli-damelio-became-one-of-the-biggest-social-media-stars-in-the-world.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Charli DAmelio Became One Of The Biggest Social Media Stars In The World">&larr;
