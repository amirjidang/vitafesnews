For instance, even though Blac Chyna was on the rise before she ever met a member of the Kardashian clan, she certainly became a lot more famous once she was linked to Kim's brother, Rob Kardashian. On top of becoming a star, Chyna has managed to amass an impressive <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$1.5 million fortune over the years</a>.</p><p>Throughout Blac Chyna’s time in the spotlight, she has proven time and time again that she is a master of garnering her fan’s attention. For example, there aren’t too many stars that could set the internet on fire simply by changing their hair color. Of course, there have been a lot of people who’ve managed to become the talk of the internet without monetizing that experience...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With that in mind, it begs an obvious question, how has Blac Chyna accumulated her impressive wealth?</p><p><strong>Updated January 2024:</strong>Blac Chyna's net worth has decreased significantly over the past several years. <strong>She had a net worth of $5 million at one point, but that number is now $1.5 million</strong>. It may be that between her businesses not doing well and attorney fees spent on cases against both Tyga and Rob Kardashian that Chyna has lost some of her fortune. But with Chyna's ability to come up with business ventures, it would not be surprising to see her net worth bounce back to a heftier sum, like it once was.</p><h2 id=black-chyna-rsquo-s-net-worth>Black Chyna’s Net Worth</h2><h3 id=blac-chyna-has-a-net-worth-of-1-5-million>Blac Chyna has a net worth of $1.5 million</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/instar53157114-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Because Blac Chyna first rose to fame as a model, it shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone that she has become quite wealthy. After all, she managed to garner enough attention in the modeling industry to get namedropped in Drake’s song “Miss Me” which is an impressive feat. On top of that, a lot of models that manage to make a name for themselves can demand a lot of money for their services.</p><p>Of course, it would be a pretty big exaggeration to describe Blac Chyna as a supermodel. As a result, it makes sense that people like Gisele Bündchen, Cindy Crawford, and Heidi Klum have a lot more money than Chyna. However, that doesn’t mean that Chyna should be underestimated given that she has $1.5 million to her name.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/kardashians-and-blac-chyna.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Dream Reportedly Lives With Khloe Kardashian, But How Often Does She See Her Mom Blac Chyna?&nbsp;</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>There's lots of speculation over Dream, and which side she's closer to, the Kardashians or Blac Chyna.</span><h2 id=blac-chyna-the-reality-tv-star>Blac Chyna The Reality TV Star</h2><h3 id=blac-chyna-starred-in-rob-amp-chyna-and-the-real-blac-chyna>Blac Chyna starred in Rob & Chyna and The Real Blac Chyna</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/instar52777663-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the years since Blac Chyna rose to fame, she has proven to be quite a hustler. She has come up with so many ways to make money that her business acumen deserves a lot of credit from the masses.</p><p>For example, on top of Chyna making money as a model, she has become a television mainstay over the last several years. Best known for starring in her own reality shows, Rob & Chyna as well as The Real Blac Chyna, she has also appeared in a slew of other shows.</p><p>While the exact amount of money Chyna has made from her television credits is unknown, it seems clear that her appearances have been quite lucrative.</p><h2 id=blac-chyna-the-actor>Blac Chyna The Actor</h2><h3 id=blac-chyna-has-been-in-a-handful-of-tv-shows-and-films>Blac Chyna has been in a handful of TV shows and films</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/instar52577550-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since first appearing in Tyga's video for "Rack City", Chyna has been attempting to make a name for herself on both the big and small screens.</p><p>Projects that Chyna has worked on in recent years, according to IMDb include:</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>The Black Hamptons (TV Series)</p></td><td><p>2022-2023</p></td><td><p>Karrin (lead)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Women Of The Jury (Movie)</p></td><td><p>2023</p></td><td><p>Dina (lead)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Vicious Affair (Movie)</p></td><td><p>2023</p></td><td><p>Kim (lead)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Secret Society 2: Never Enough (Movie)</p></td><td><p>2022</p></td><td><p>Vicki (lead)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Only CAM: LA (TV Series)</p></td><td><p>2020</p></td><td><p>Blac Chyna (self)</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=blac-chyna-is-a-social-media-influencer>Blac Chyna Is A Social Media Influencer</h2><h3 id=blac-chyna-made-between-2-to-3-million-from-onlyfans>Blac Chyna made between $2 to $3 million from OnlyFans</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/instar52478040-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though Blac Chyna is a major media personality, she also is qualified to call herself a social media influencer. Just like a lot of her peers in that area, Chyna has recently begun to make a lot of money directly from her fans. For example, Chyna has made a pretty penny promoting brands over Twitter and Instagram.</p><p>Chyna once had an OnlyFans account on social media. However, she shut that down amid wanting to change her life. While it was estimated that she made hundreds of millions on OnlyFans, Chyna claimed that was not true. It was $2 to $3 million at most.</p><p>On top of all that, Chyna offered to have a <a href=#>chat virtually with fans</a> over FaceTime for $950 or to follow anyone on Instagram for $250.</p><h2 id=blac-chyna-is-an-accomplished-entrepreneur>Blac Chyna Is An Accomplished Entrepreneur</h2><h3 id=blac-chyna-has-started-both-a-clothing-line-and-an-eyelash-kit-company>Blac Chyna has started both a clothing line and an eyelash kit company</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/instar51733103-2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though Blac Chyna has made a lot of money from the media, she also has found the time to become quite the entrepreneur. For example, in 2013 Chyna launched an online boutique called “88fin” which sold clothes under the same brand. During that same period, Chyna began selling adhesive eyelashes she called “Lashed by Blac Chyna”. Still not enough though, in early 2014 Chyna bought a beauty bar in Encino, Los Angeles, and under her management, the business offered makeup courses to the public.</p><p>Unfortunately, a lot of people who launch businesses wind up losing their initial investment and closing up shop over time. In the case of Blac Chyna, however, that hasn’t been the case as she has kept things going for many years now. Of course, there are many reasons why any entrepreneur manages to enjoy success. In the case of Blac Chyna, it seems likely that one of the keys to her success is her willingness to evolve.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For example, “Lashed by Blac Chyna” is still going strong and Chyna has extended the brand by selling cosmetics like eyeliner. As for Chyna’s clothing brand, her fashion line is now called “Blac Chyna Closet”. But given that Chyna claimed in October 2023 that she had to sell personal items to make ends meet, it may be that the clothing line is not doing as well as expected.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZpZmTYrCpxc2aZKedpGLEsL7ToWScmaKasrN7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./which-friends-co-star-is-lisa-kudrow-closest-to.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Which 'Friends' Co-Star Is Lisa Kudrow Closest To?">&larr;
