This started in South Korea when he was stationed as an air policeman in the United States Air Force. Chuck Norris was given the honorary title of Marine in 2006 by the Marine Corp for his support of the military branch and his campaign of Protect What You’ve Earned.

He crafted his own line of jeans called “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Action Jeans</a>” that were made from superior quality denim material. The cut and style of the jeans were perfect for any kind of movement, especially martial arts stances. Chuck Norris really was one great all-rounder who made the best of everything.
