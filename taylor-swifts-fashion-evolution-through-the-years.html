The 11-time Grammy winner launched into stardom after writing songs based on her personal experiences, including some songs written about other fellow celebrities like John Mayer or Joe Jonas. While Taylor may have become famous for her music career, she has recently started to be recognized for her timeless fashion sense. <a href=#>Much like one of her best friends and fellow popstar, Selena Gomez</a>, Swift has gone through many style changes over her career growing up in the spotlight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>9 Celebrities Who Practice Sustainable Fashion</a></span>As an artist who has influenced a generation of singer-songwriters it's only fitting she influences the fashion of a generation as well. The producer who always favored dresses and gowns started letting her country roots influence her fashion with regular appearing cowgirl boots early on in her career. She quickly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">changed into more refined mature gowns showcasing her elevated status while maintaining her youthful appearance</a> and trademark curly blonde locks. Developing another fashion trademark, she started rocking red lips with nearly all of her looks starting in 2009 well before and then past the release of her fourth album aptly named, Red. Swift has since realized she doesn't need a fashion trademark to be recognized and has fully embraced creating unique fashion moments for her fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift-takes-fashion-advice-from-the-regency-era><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Taylor Swift Takes Fashion Advice From The Regency Era</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/t-1.jpg><p>Early in her career, the actress favored ultra-feminine gowns going as far as to even wear a Regency-inspired gold beaded satin gown to the 2007 CMA's. The actress who looked like she belonged in Beauty and the Beast has come a long way in her fashion journey since her younger years. Ditching the wide silhouettes for something more fitted and leaving behind the old idea that as a woman she needed to be more feminine in glamorous dresses for menswear-inspired looks in her later years.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>8 Celebrities Who Defined Their Own Style</a></span></p><h2 id=the-birth-of-taylor-39-s-red-lips><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>The Birth Of Taylor's Red Lips</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kayne-West-Interrupts-Taylor-Swift-at-the-VMAs.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The same year that previous <a href=#>Kardashian husband rapper-producer, Kanye West</a>, interrupted Taylor's acceptance speech for Best Female Video at the 2009 VMAs, Taylor Swift debuted a new red lipstick to perfectly compliment all of her outfits. After wearing the shade for the first time on the cover of Allure, the singer was almost never spotted again without red lips. Since then, she has gone through many shades of red over the years even adopting a much brighter red for the release of her fourth album of the same name. Her love for the color goes so far that the songstress often name-drops her favorite Nars shade in more than a few of her songs.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-loves-a-good-costume><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Taylor Swift Loves A Good Costume</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/IMG_B1960768F1D9-1.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With the release of her second studio album "Fearless" in 2008, Swift went on a world tour for the album from 2009 until 2010 where she often wore elaborate outfits and even costumes. A fan favorite and ode to her own high school experience she wore a version of a marching uniform during the tour. As a member of the band herself, Swift has mentioned her experience in some of her songs including You Belong With Me off the same album. In her later years, she brought out marching bands during her performances in her "Lover" era.</p><h2 id=taylor-goes-from-country-to-pop-princess><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Taylor Goes From Country To Pop Princess</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-20-at-20052-PM.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After sporting country casual at the very beginning of her career, Taylor switched to a more innocent youthful style reflecting her switch to the pop category with her second and third albums. Sweeping up nearly every award possible during her music career including winning the Ultimate Choice Award at the Teen Choice Awards in 2011 where she was pictured with Justin Bieber and an adorable Joey King. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">As her music changed and matured so did her wardrobe</a> with the singer starting to rock more form-fitting and refined pieces.</p><h2 id=fans-recognize-taylor-even-with-straight-hair><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Fans Recognize Taylor Even With Straight Hair</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Taylor-Swift-TIME-100.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Always known for her curly golden blonde hairstyle, Taylor switched it up in 2010 when she cut her bangs and started straightening her hair. While some fans didn't approve and thought she ruined her hair most fans were supportive of the change and loved the new hairdo. Straightening her hair gave her even more of an edge adding to the already sexy mature look she was starting to adopt proving to fans that Taylor was no longer a teen. While the artist has kept the bangs which proved to be the perfect look for her, she has since stopped straightening her hair often and is normally seen rocking her natural curls.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Taylor Swift Announces A New Surprise Album</a></span></p><h2 id=taylor-bringing-the-drama-to-the-met-gala><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Taylor Bringing The Drama To The Met Gala</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/IMG_3779.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the <a href=#>biggest events in fashion is the annual Met Gala where celebrities show off their unique style</a> for charity on the red carpet. Attending her first Met Gala in 2008, Taylor had just started her transition from rustic chic to glitzy glamour. The 2011 Met Gala would be the third time she attended the event and her added experience was clear in her dress choice which managed to steal the spotlight. After years of flowing gowns and simple silhouettes, the actress surprised fans with a dramatic J. Mendel gown which featured a raw-edged train and lace accents. Cementing her status as not only a music icon but a fashion icon for a generation of young women.</p><h2 id=feeling-like-an-old-cardigan-sometimes><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Feeling Like An Old Cardigan Sometimes</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/IMG_AAF3CE652241-1.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With the release of her eighth studio album "Folklore", Taylor started dressing more comfortably with oversized sweaters and her new closet staple, cardigans. Her love for the garment piece goes so deep that she named and wrote a song about cardigans on her eighth album which has since become one of her most popular songs. Since she no longer feels like she needs to prove her success through glamorous clothing or show what genre she is in by wearing cowgirl boots the star has come out of her styling shell to become known as one of most fashionable singers of our generation for her unique and timeless styling choices.</p><h2 id=becoming-a-fashion-icon><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Becoming A Fashion Icon</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Dylan-OBrien-Taylor-Swift-and-Sadie-Sink.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After adding acting to her resume, the businesswoman added director with her short film starring Dylan O'Brien and Sadie Sink based on her fan-favorite song All Too Well. The song was featured on her fourth studio album "Red" as a five-minute track, but Swift ultimately released the full 10-minute version after departing from her previous record label. The director looked stunning at the premiere of the movie in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">simple dark purple velvet suit a far cry away from her early years of girly dresses and glitter</a>. This moment was not only big for her career but pivotal for her fashion with Taylor showing she can wear whatever she wants while knowing what looks good on her and managing to create timeless outfits that will never go out of style.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>8 Biggest Celebrities Dior Has Worked With Over The Years</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina2rXZuutLTIqKVmnaakubbAyKilZqyYp7y2s8dmq6GdXa6yor7SaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./addison-raes-mom-sheri-easterling-speaks-out-on-marital-drama.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Addison Rae's Mom Sheri Easterling Speaks Out on Marital Drama">&larr;
