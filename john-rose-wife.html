When he was 45, this Tennessee lawmaker wed a college freshman.</p><p>John Rose, and his wife, Chelsea Doss Rose, appear to have a perfect marriage. The couple has been together for more than ten years and was married in January 2011.&nbsp;</p><p>John Williams Rose, a businessman, and politician from the United States have represented Tennessee’s 6th congressional district.&nbsp;</p><p>He was the president of Boson Software, LLC, and the Tennessee agriculture commissioner. He was a Republican.</p><p>In 2009, Chelsea Doss, a junior at Tennessee Tech University, was chosen to serve as a national officer for the FFA.</p><p>Doss, who was studying agribusiness, considered the selection to be an honor.&nbsp;</p><p>She had been involved in the group since high school, and the university spoke with her to highlight the achievement in a news release.</p><p>During the interview, Doss lavishly praised John Rose, a 44-year-old Tennessee Tech alum and chairman of the board managing university fundraising.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, he served as the board’s chair for the Tennessee FFA’s honors and scholarships.&nbsp;</p><p>Following the press release, Rose, a software executive, and owner of an investment company provided the university with most of its funding.&nbsp;</p><p>He established a scholarship in their honor as one of his initiatives. Chelsea Doss received the scholarship that year.&nbsp;</p><p>She said once in her interview, “John has made everything possible that I’ve done in FFA beyond high school.”Further, she said, “Through his scholarship, I’ve not had to have a job through college, and I’ve been able to train, improve, focus on FFA and focus on school. That scholarship has made all the difference.”</p><p>She added: “He has also coached me during my preparation, which has been extremely helpful.”</p><p>A separate announcement appeared in the Eagleville Times, a small newspaper in Doss’ home county, fourteen months later: Doss and Rose, who were nearly 25 years apart in age, were engaged to be married.&nbsp;</p><p>Doss had yet to earn his undergraduate degree. Rose is still involved with the FFA and continues meeting with the organization’s student chapter members during state conventions.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Children of John Rose and Chelsea</h2><p>After more than ten years, Doss and Rose are still in a <a href=#>relationship</a>. They appear to be the parents of a contented family with two boys, Beth and Jeff Doss</p><p>The couple’s first child, Guy, was born in April 2017.</p><p>After Chelsea’s water unexpectedly broke in November 2019, the couple lost a child. Baby Mack was taken to Chelsea but was too little to survive outside the womb. They wrote</p><p>Rose said, “We are heartbroken by the unexpected loss of our anticipated baby boy. God filled our hearts with joy and hope when we learned that we would be blessed with another child. We may not get to walk with him in this life, but we pray we see him in Glory one day.“</p><p>Sam, the couple’s youngest child, was born in March 2021.</p><p>In March 2022, Rose commented on a photo,<strong> “He’s one year old today.”</strong> He is moving around, investigating, and constantly curious about what big brother is doing. We cherish you, friend!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>John Rose’s wife’s age – The age difference between the couple</h2><p>Chelsea Doss is 33 years old as of 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>Growingly popular on <a href=#>social media</a>, the age difference between John and his wife is a hot issue. Furthermore, he awarded her a 4H scholarship when they first met. At that time, she was 16.</p><p>At the time of her wedding, she was 22 years old only, and Rose was 45. There is a 22 age gap between them.</p><p>She participated in basketball and softball and also attended Eagleville High School before continuing her education at Tennessee Technological University.</p><p>In 2011, she obtained a qualification in the subject of Agricultural Communications.</p><p>She actively participates in fundraising alongside her spouse to support his efforts to promote the Future Farmers of America.</p><p>Regarding her professional background, she volunteered at a Tennessee-based non-profit FFA organization, where she held the position of executive director from 2014 and 2017.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC2zqGlZqqfqLJuw8ifnGg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./natasha-vaynblat-age-wiki-biography-height-boyfriend-instagram.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Natasha Vaynblat Age, Wiki, Biography, Height, Boyfriend, Instagram">&larr;
