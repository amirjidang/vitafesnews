Digga D, another well-known English rapper, released a diss track about how he attacked Central’s brother, and the rapper was standing there helpless.</p><p>While Digga’s diss track does not mention which brother he is talking about, fans quickly deduce the rapper is talking about Juke in his song.</p><p>Central has not revealed anything about his other siblings on the web yet. He tries to keep his family and siblings away from the web or his spotlight to avoid unwanted media attention.</p><p>The rapper was also rumored to be a relative of Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu, a Turkish actress and Love Island contestant, but the actress was quick to shut down all the rumors.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=rapper-central-cee-age-and-wiki></span>Rapper Central Cee Age and Wiki<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Rapper Central Cee’s actual age is 24 years old as of 2022.

By the time he was 14, he had already recorded his first song after visiting a recording studio with his school friend.</p><p>He attended Chelsea Academy in childhood and was a few years senior to fellow rapper Digga D. According to Cee’s Wikipedia profile, the rapper kept to himself at school but sometimes lost his temper with his classmates.</p><p>The rapper left home early. He was already living around with his friends when he recorded his first song. He realized he could achieve more when he wandered off into different parts of London on his own and realized how big the world was from his imagination.</p><p>Apart from making music, the rapper worked in a shoe store before quitting after just three weeks when he knew about his wages.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=central-cee-parents-and-family></span>Central Cee Parents and Family<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Talking about his parents, Central Cee was born to an Irish mother and a Guyanese father.</p><p>His parents played a vital role in shaping his today’s successful music career during his childhood.</p><p>The rapper’s father would often play music around him, creating a musical atmosphere around the already talented rapper at home.</p><p>However, Cee has never revealed the names of his parents to his followers or on the web.
