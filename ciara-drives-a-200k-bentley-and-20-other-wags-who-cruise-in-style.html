It’s not that it’s a secret. From paparazzi pics to social media posts, it seems like many of them just love to show off their premium rides, along with the bling, the cash, the exotic vacations, and all the rest of the lifestyle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From classic and classy Bentleys and Mercedes to super-fast Ferraris and Lamborghinis, rare racers and muscle cars, the garages of the rich athletes of the world are overflowing with cars and vehicles the rest of us can just drool over. We can’t even imagine the kind of insurance rates these dudes must pay to protect their shiny investments.</p><p>It’s not a coincidence that a few of the WAGs in question even make a living from modeling with luxury vehicles. Hotties and hot rides go together so well. Here’s a look at 21 of the WAGs with the best rides.</p><h2 id=ciara><strong>Ciara</strong></h2><p>Ciara is a WAG, but also a pop singer in her own right, which is good because it seems like the lady has a taste for fine vehicles. While she was previously engaged to rapper Future, the two bought matching sleek Bentley Continental V8 GTs. Since that relationship broke up, she’s married Seattle Seahawks QB Russell Wilson, which seems to have added to her car collection. She’s been spotted in a white Mercedes 4X4, and a Lamborghini Gallardo worth about $200K. On a date night in 2016, then pregnant Ciara and hubby Russell pulled up to a restaurant in a vintage British MG convertible from the 1960s worth about $300K. That’s not even counting Russell’s collection, which includes a Range Rover and a Tesla.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jessica-lawlor><strong>Jessica Lawlor</strong></h2><p>Back in 2009, Stephen Ireland was making about $100K a week as a star player for Manchester City. He was only 23, but had been dating girlfriend Jessica Lawlor for about four years already when her 24th birthday came around. His gift to her was a customized Bentley worth just under $370K. It was loaded with personal touches. Instead of the Bentley B on the hood, it sports her initials of JL. The seats are red leather with an embroidered heart and the words 'To Jess Love From Stephen'. The car has a 552bhp engine and can roar from zero to sixty in under 5 seconds. It was an extravagant gesture, but the sentiment behind it seems sincere. The couple were married in a lavish ceremony in 2016 and are still together today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fanny-neguesha><strong>Fanny Neguesha</strong></h2><p>Fanny Neguesha was engaged to famed Italian striker Mario Balotelli in March 2013. Sadly, the engagement lasted only six months, but during that time, Fanny’s ride was an Audi A5 convertible, a popular choice with the one percent. The car is a high performance vehicle with a 333hp engine and all-wheel drive. Worth about $60K, it’s said to be a smooth ride with all the luxurious perks. The stunning model and famous footballer made a striking couple and were media favorites while it lasted. While Fanny said the two were still friends, she cited jealousy as the main reason for the split.</p><h2 id=shakira><strong>Shakira</strong></h2><p>Colombian singer Shakira and FC Barcelona center back Gerard Piqué share two children, living quarters in Spain, and a relationship that dates back to 2010 – but no wedding ring. That hasn't prevented Shakira from accumulating a collection of luxury vehicles, among other things. Her go-to ride is said to be a classic Mercedes Benz SL600 worth a cool $135K. The Merc sports a 5.8-liter 36-valve V-12 engine, and it can go from zero to 60mph in about 5.4 seconds. The perfect ride for a mom on the go.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=irina-shayk><strong>Irina Shayk</strong></h2><p>Irina Shayk dated football superstar Cristiano Ronaldo for about five years between 2010 and 2015. Irina was known as a lingerie and swimsuit model, often appearing in the famed Sports Illustrated swimsuit issues. During the time she was dating the Portuguese footballer, photogenic Irina was often pictured buzzing around town in his vehicles. One of her faves was reported to be a super fast Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano. Worth about $330K, the Fiorano jumps from zero to 60mph in a mere 3.7 seconds. These days, the Russian former model is hooked up with Bradley Cooper, and the two had a baby in March 2017. Wonder if she kept any of Ronaldo’s cars?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=morgan-poole-bledsoe><strong>Morgan Poole Bledsoe</strong></h2><p>Eric Bledsoe is a point guard for the Milwaukee Bucks these days. His career in the NBA has had its share of ups and downs, but his relationship with Morgan Poole seems to have gone much more smoothly. The pair first met in high school back in Birmingham, Alabama, and went official in 2008. She's been with him through thick and thin, and the two tied the knot in 2017. It's only right that she should share the spoils, which includes multiple vehicles such as a Range Rover, Ferrari, and Cadillac Escalade.</p><h2 id=vanessa-bryant><strong>Vanessa Bryant</strong></h2><p>Vanessa was 19 and Kobe was 22 when they first met, and the two have been married since 2001. That marriage has had its share of roller coaster turns, including attempted divorce, and even legal charges of infidelity and rape against Kobe, but through it all, Vanessa kept her eye on the prize. After 20 years in the NBA and five championship rings, Kobe has a sizable net worth and the family lives in a mansion on the California coast. Vanessa gets to choose from a number of luxury rides, including a Lamborghini Murcielago, Ferrari 360 Modena and also a 458 Italia, and a Bentley Continental GT, among others.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=alex-gerrard><strong>Alex Gerrard</strong></h2><p>Former pro footballer Steven Gerrard and wife Alex celebrated ten years of marriage in June 2017. It's been a solid marriage despite the strains of the lifestyle, with four children to keep it real. Steven played for Liverpool and LA Galaxy in an 18 year career, and now coaches and manages the Liverpool U18 team. In other words, he can afford to keep Alex, a former model, in cars like the convertible Bentley she often drives, said to be worth just under $300K, or the black Aston Martin with its 517hp and maximum 6500 RPMs.</p><h2 id=teyana-taylor><strong>Teyana Taylor</strong></h2><p>Singer and actress Teyana Taylor married Cleveland Cavaliers shooting guard Iman Shumpert in 2016. The ceremony formalized a relationship that had already produced son Iman Jr. She’s a successful recording artist in her own right, which is probably necessary to feed their collective car fetish, even with his $8.9 million salary. Iman the elder has a real taste for expensive rides, which include a rare Koenigsegg CCXR sports car worth about $1.2 million. As for Teyana, she’s been seen in a Bentley Bentayga and a Porsche Panorama, and she often shares pics of them in her social media feeds.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=michelle-game><strong>Michelle Game</strong></h2><p>Michelle Game has quite a history as a WAG. She was once engaged to NBA Mavericks forward Charlie Villanueva, and the two had a baby together. When that ended, she went on to Dallas Cowboys quarterback, Dak Prescott. Nowadays, her social media feeds are occupied with glamour shots and pics that promote her line of exercise wear. But, during her engagement to Villaneueva, she often posted pictures of herself with high end vehicles like this Ferrari convertible, among other accoutrements of her upscale lifestyle.</p><h2 id=amber-alvarez><strong>Amber Alvarez</strong></h2><p>DeaAndre Jordan of the Los Angeles Clippers and girlfriend Amber Alvarez have gone through some ups and downs. During one of those down times, he fathered a child with another woman. But, Amber has apparently forgiven all, and the two are back together. While DeaAndre is pretty cagey about showing off his lifestyle, Amber is milking it for all its worth with frequent social media posts that display their exotic car collection, including a matte black Tesla. It makes sense – model Amber frequently works to promote cars and auto shows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gabrielle-union><strong>Gabrielle Union</strong></h2><p>Actress Gabrielle Union seems to have a thing for pro athletes. She dated Jason Kidd before he hit the NBA while the two were still in high school, and married and divorced NFL player Chris Howard between 2001 and 2005. Then, in 2009 she began dating NBA star Dwayne Wade. After a brief split in 2013, the two got married in 2014 and are still going strong. Both of them are known to love their vehicle collection, which includes a Ferrari&nbsp;F12 Berlinetta, McLaren MP4-12C in red, and an Audi R8. Just last year, Dwayne surprised his wife with the gift of a new Mercedes convertible in classic black.</p><h2 id=kayla-wallace><strong>Kayla Wallace</strong></h2><p>NBA Celtics guard Isaiah Thomas married his long time sweetheart Kayla Wallace back in 2016. He described his wedding as "by far the best day in my life" in a social media post, and the two are still posting mushy notes to each other on Instagram on a regular basis. The couple knew each other as far back as their student days at Washington State, and the relationship was described as a "long courtship". It makes all the perks that much sweeter in the end, we’re guessing – including a Bentley Continental in the garage of their estate in California that Kayla is said to favor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ayesha-curry><strong>Ayesha Curry</strong></h2><p>While Stephen Curry makes headlines as the point guard for the red hot Golden State Warriors of the NBA, wife Ayesha Curry is cooking up a storm on her own show on the Food Network. They met as teenagers, got married in 2011, and have a solid relationship by the looks of it, along with two healthy bank accounts. Stephen’s car collection includes a Range Rover, Porsche Panamera, and Cadillac Escalade. In 2016, Ayesha took to Instagram to show the world the Mercedes G-class SUV Steph had just bought her – G-Wagons being a vehicle of choice for the upscale set.</p><h2 id=savannah-brinson-jones><strong>Savannah Brinson Jones</strong></h2><p>Savannah Brinson Jones met future hubby LeBron James when the two were high schoolers in Cleveland. She’s been through his side through thick and thin, as they say, although we’ll note that when it comes to King James, the going has been mostly on the thicker side. With a net worth estimated at over $400 million, LeBron is known for his own selection of fine vehicles, including a Ferrari 458, a Mercedes-Benz S63 AMG, and a Maybach 57S. In 2016, on Savannah’s 30th birthday, he gifted her with a shiny new Ferrari of her very own, all white with a red bow. Happy birthday Savannah.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kendra-wilkinson><strong>Kendra Wilkinson</strong></h2><p>Kendra Wilkinson first caught the public’s eye as one of Hugh Hefner’s girlfriends on Girls Next Door from 2005 to 2009. Once she’d had enough of the life of a paid Playmate to the old man, she went on to become a WAG when she met and began dating Hank Baskett of the NFL. Among their multiple vehicles, Kendra is known to drive her white GMC Yukon around town, and got into a crash with her Audi in 2013. Even with all the material wealth, the relationship has been a roller coaster, according to reports, including a 2014 scandal with model Ava Sabrina London, and Kendra is reported to be contemplating divorce in January 2018.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ashley-nicole-roberts><strong>Ashley Nicole Roberts</strong></h2><p>One of the stars of WAGs Miami, the engagement and wedding of Ashley Nicole Roberts and NFL free agent, Phillip Wheeler, happened on the show in front of their audience in 2017. The couple have been together since 2009, and have a son together. Ashley loves sharing her wealthy lifestyle on Instagram, and that has included a series of high end vehicles. Her fave is said to be a Mercedes G-Wagon, the preferred ride of many WAGs it seems. Wheeler just signed a deal with the Arizona Cardinals in December 2017, which bodes well for the future of their car collection.</p><h2 id=kristin-cavallari><strong>Kristin Cavallari</strong></h2><p>Kristin Cavallari was a reality star in the MTV series Laguna Beach before she met and then married Miami Dolphins QB Jay Cutler in 2013. Since the end of her TV series, she’s been involved in fashion design and acting, but hubby’s $85 million net worth means she doesn’t have to worry about being between gigs. Kristin’s rides include a Range Rover, a BMW X5, and a BMW 3 Series Coupe – that’s in addition to Jay’s Rolls Royce Ghost, Lamborghini, and Jaguar.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=claudia-sampedro><strong>Claudia Sampedro</strong></h2><p>Claudia Sampedro is a popular model with a considerable following on social media. She’s the long time live-in girlfriend of Carolina Panthers defensive end Julius Pepper. They’ve been living together since 2014, and in 2016, she joined the cast of WAGS Miami. Despite the fact the two have a son together – and Claudia's obvious hinting on the show – Julius has yet to pop the question. That doesn't mean he’s been stingy with perks, though. Claudia often models with hot cars, and isn't shy about showing her 1 million plus Instagram followers her all about her lavish lifestyle, including this flashy yellow number.</p><h2 id=dominique-penn><strong>Dominique Penn</strong></h2><p>Dominique Penn has been married to NFL star Donald Penn since 2012. The couple are still together, but that doesn’t mean they haven’t seen their share of drama, including an extramarital baby with reality TV star Camilla Poindexter in 2016. She’s one of the stars of WAGS LA, where naturally the two project a family first image. Donald signed a 2-year contract with the Oakland Raiders in 2017 for $21 million, and it looks like he will need it to keep the mothers of his children happy. As for Dominique, she often poses with her luxury vehicles on social media posts, like this one with her fave Bentley. Along with Dominique’s cars, their garage holds Donald’s Ferrari, Mercedes Maybach, and Mercedes-Benz AMG.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=candice-crawford><strong>Candice Crawford</strong></h2><p>Tony Romo was the Dallas Cowboys’ QB when he met and married Candice Crawford, a former Miss Missouri USA and journalist. Tony’s multi-million dollar NFL salaries were fattened with endorsement deals for Gatorade and Pizza Hut, among others, which keep the couple and their three children in a nice mansion in Dallas with a big garage. Inside it, the couple keeps an Audi, a Range Rover, classic Ford Mustang and other American muscle cars. Their collection is estimated at $3.5 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKifp8G0ecSnq56qpJa2r7nEp6tom5mWv6J5w6ugr52jYq5ufo9pomaalaPBrbHYZpinnF1nfW6706Gcq2WnlrS0edahpmaboqq2tLGMoqVmq6SuuaZ7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./courteney-cox-sells-longtime-la-home-to-next-door-neighbor-for-4-5-million.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Courteney Cox Sells Longtime LA Home to Next-Door Neighbor For $4.5 Million">&larr;
