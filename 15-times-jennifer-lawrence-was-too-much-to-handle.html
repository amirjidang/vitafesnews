Lawrence, who is known for her major movie roles, is also known for hitting back at claims and vocalizing her strong opinions to the media without a filter. Just recently, she bit back at Joanna Lumley who complimented Lawrence's looks; we guess J. Law is not a big fan of compliments.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The former Hunger Games star is not afraid to use her popularity to speak out about anything; from feminism, to politics, to body issues and even criticizing a reporter, Lawrence has not been the quietest actress through her mere 7-year career. Most of the world has fallen in love with her because of her big mouth, constantly sharing her stories with a little&nbsp; too much information and constantly slamming back at the media, whereas some are annoyed by her and cannot stand her. We may have rolled our eyes at her a couple of times, but when it comes to the loud-mouth star, we love her because she is honest and raw. And if anyone is going to make face planting look good and make flipping off a room full of journalists seem proper, it’s J.Law herself. That being said, let us take a look at Lawrence's crazy antics in the public sphere.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-she-was-rude-to-joanna-lumley><strong>When She Was Rude To Joanna Lumley</strong></h2><p>Sometimes things are better left unsaid, but J.Law does not give that saying second thought. Besides the outstanding movie roles that she is known for, she is also now known to always make a statement.</p><p><strong>The thing is, J.Law knows what kind of person she is and quite frankly, does not care what anyone says, and so she pushed her luck, again, at a recent event.</strong></p><p>Lawrence bit back at Joanna Lumley at the 2018 BAFTA ceremony when Lumley introduced Lawrence as “the hottest actress on the planet.” However, who else except J.Law would disregard a compliment and reply, “That was a bit much,” instead of saying a proper thank you? Following the ceremony, she was slammed for being rude and the American darling obviously had a typical and sarcastic J.Law reply stating: “I wasn’t being rude, it was an inside joke. I mean I’m always rude.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-she-named-her-cat-after-chaz-bono><strong>When She Named Her Cat After Chaz Bono</strong></h2><p>J.Law often rambles without realizing what she is saying, which is totally Jennifer Lawrence being Jennifer Lawrence. And because of that, she often pushes her luck, like the time she was on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. During the interview, she explained to Ellen why she named her female cat Chaz Bono.&nbsp;Although the whole thing seemed so innocent and&nbsp;funny to some, others were pretty insulted.</p><p><strong>"I’ve never met a cat where you assume first that it’s a boy. Because normally dogs are boys and cats are girls.</strong></p><p>But she has such a masculine energy that everybody always says 'he,' and for the first week I thought it was a boy. And that’s just weird for a cat.&nbsp;So we call her Chaz Bono." Basically, Cher's son Bono is transgender, so Lawrence's remark&nbsp;was a joke about his gender identity, leading the media to criticize her until this day for her uncalled-for punchline.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-she-decided-body-shaming-should-be-illegal><strong>When She Decided Body Shaming Should Be Illegal</strong></h2><p>If there is another thing that Lawrence is vocal about, it's body shaming and body shamers and she has addressed the matter since 2013. J.Law has often been subjected to body shaming&nbsp;from the beginning of her career, but she has also had a loud mouth since the start of her career, so she takes every chance she gets to slam the haters. One instance specifically got a lot of backlash because she told Barbara Walters in an interview that she wants it to be deemed illegal to comment on someone's weight. By making this statement, the media criticized her because she said:</p><p><strong>"I think when it comes to the media, the media needs to take responsibility for the effect it has on our younger generation.</strong></p><p>So then all of a sudden, being funny is making fun of the girl that's wearing an ugly dress ... and the word fat."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-she-made-face-planting-a-thing><strong>When She Made Face Planting A Thing</strong></h2><p>Because the media gets harassed by J.Law's free-spirited attitude, when she has her "downfalls," the media is the first to jump on the occasion of criticizing her. What are we talking about here? J.Law's classic face plants. Those that do not even know about Lawrence's filmography know that the actress is famous for busting and tumbling. The first time it happened, she owned it like a boss, as she "attempted" to collect her Oscar award for The Silver Linings Playbook. Classic J.Law laughed it off during her acceptance speech, until it happened to her again.</p><p><strong>As if the first time was not enough, since her plunge was doing the rounds around the world, the year later, Lawrence went down again, this time, on the red carpet.</strong></p><p>This gave ammunition to the media as they whispered to the world that J.Law faked the fall in true JL style. They think she's too much, we think she is a klutz.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-she-called-out-the-media-again><strong>When She Called&nbsp;Out The Media...Again&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Lawrence and the media have a great hate-hate relationship, and she just does not care. This never-ending affair continued when J.Law, this week, had another event to add to her saga. And when she is mad and offended,&nbsp;social media better watch out. During the press tour for her latest film Red Sparrow, Lawrence was photographed in a stunning solid black, plunging neckline Versace dress along her bundled-up male co-stars. Media outlets took to social media to criticize her outfit choice and the brave Lawrence does not want any of it.</p><p><strong>The viral photo was headlined by one media outlet saying: "Please Give Jennifer Lawrence a Dang Coat,"</strong></p><p>and Lawrence evidently bit the dust. Dissing her fashion choice, Lawrence fought back exclaiming: "This is sexist, this is ridiculous, this is not feminism." Was she overreacting? No, it's J.Law. Let the woman stand&nbsp;in her dress in the cold if she wants to!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-she-called-out-meryl-streep><strong>When She Called Out Meryl Streep</strong></h2><p>J.Law is not a difficult woman; we've come to confirm that she is officially done with worrying about how she sounds or what other people think of her. She does not care for seeming adorable when speaking her mind, and spurts things out like she was born with no filter. There will always be errant whispers going around when people, mostly media outlets, think Lawrence made a statement that was "out of line" — but nothing is per se when cool-cat Lawrence speaks. While accepting her Golden Globe in 2013, she muttered out with no second thought, "I beat Meryl." And of course, the backlash came and JL had to explain herself since there was so much commotion and confusion. Some thought she was being snotty, while J.Law said:</p><p><strong>"It is never a good idea for me to wing it."</strong></p><p>What they did not catch on to was that this comment was simply a First Wives Club reference.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-she-uses-words-that-upset-people><strong>When She&nbsp;Uses Words That Upset People</strong></h2><p>Lawrence does not always use her words carefully; she is strong on her feet when it comes to issues like feminism, but sometimes loses track and forgets what she says. Jennifer Lawrence needs a miniature Jennifer Lawrence subconscious on her shoulder to give her the go before she murmurs comments that might accidentally offend the people she doesn't want to offend. One word that she seems to have forgotten to leave out of her&nbsp;vocabulary&nbsp;is "d*ke,"&nbsp;— she has said&nbsp;it as casually as she's said pizza. When commenting about herself as a child, “I was really d*key as a kid I liked to play a lot of sports.” The problem here was that was Lawrence's first big interview with Rolling Stone — what an unfortunate causality — that comment still haunts her to this day.</p><h2 id=when-a-video-of-j-law-was-leaked><strong>When A Video Of J.Law Was Leaked</strong></h2><p>It seems Jennifer Lawrence keeps reaching dangerous levels because of her "so what" attitude. If she wants to dig into an entire pizza, she will, just as much as she will try and pole dance. And you know that if you criticize her about it, she will bite back — and she usually makes those mocking her seem like fools. In May 2017, while at a best friend's birthday bash, a video surfaced on social media of her pole dancing with a "bra." Immediately, she was criticized by fans and received backlash from media outlets. And what did the witty J.Law write on a Facebook post? “Nobody wants to be reminded that they tried to dance on a s pole by the Internet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>It was one of my best friend's birthdays and I dropped my paranoia guard for one second to have fun. I'm not going to apologize, I had a blast that night.”</strong></p><p>And she added: “PS, that's not a bra it's an Alexander Wang top and I'm not going to lie, I think my dancing's pretty good. Even with no core strength.”</p><h2 id=when-she-flips-it-up><strong>When She Flips It Up</strong></h2><p>If you are looking for someone who is willing to flip off a room full of important people following one of Hollywood's biggest nights, reach out to J.Law. And if anyone is able to give the world the middle finger and make it look sassy, it's also J.Law. This was the same night that she tumbled up the stage to accept her Oscar. Later that night, while in the press room, journalists were graced by Lawrence's middle finger, and the best part of it all, was her facial expression upon sticking up the bird; she showed us that she was just as shocked as we were. Not that we believe it, but when the media attacked her for her inappropriate behavior, she blamed it on the fact that she was bolstered by the liquid substance known as alcohol. Journalists have obviously not forgiven her for the "I'm sorry I took a shot" excuse.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-she-changed-her-mind-about-activism><strong>When She Changed Her Mind About Activism</strong></h2><p>Hearing the name Jennifer Lawrence should immediately make one think, "who or what is going to be the next punchline in her joke?" but this time, the joke was not all too funny to many.</p><p><strong>The once-upon-a-time American sweetheart is getting heavy backlash against her when she recently lied about taking a break from acting to&nbsp;focus on being an activist.</strong></p><p>Her latest act is being coined as the worst instance of white feminism ever because of the way her agent made the statement for her saying: "she will return to work when one of several projects in development is ready to go." This was deemed an insult to actual activists who work their entire lives to evoke a change. Basically, if she was planning to be an activist between lucrative acting jobs, they want an apology from her for making such an overblown statement of dedication.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-she-got-upset-at-a-reporter><strong>When She&nbsp;Got Upset At&nbsp;A Reporter</strong></h2><p>A moment we all remember too well is when Jennifer Lawrence decided to tell off a reporter for using his phone — because that is exactly the way J.Law would want to end a night after her Golden Globe win. That night should have been a night of triumph for the actress, but instead, she found herself the subject of criticism. We did not know that Lawrence was that insensitive until that very moment, especially considering the fact that the reporter seemed foreign to the eyes of everyone in the room. While waving her hand rudely, she told the journalist abruptly and like he was her best bud,</p><p><strong>"You can’t just live your life behind your phone bro. You can’t do that, you’ve gotta live in the now."</strong></p><p>Many were left heartbroken when trying to decide if that remark was incredibly rude or incredibly ignorant.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-she-mocked-a-culture><strong>When She Mocked A Culture</strong></h2><p>Sometimes, we really do not know if we should praise and forgive Lawrence for not caring or condemn her. While shooting The Hunger Games: Catching Fire in 2012, Lawrence was in Hawaii and acted up again, receiving scathing criticism for it. Lawrence thought it funny to rub her behind on sacred rocks; an act that she willingly and openly spoke about and referred to as "butt-scratching." The Twitter world, along with media outlets, blew up because while Lawrence was explaining her anecdote on The Graham Norton Show,</p><p><strong>she seemed amused and proud of the fact that she knowingly disrespected someone's culture and sacred artifacts.</strong></p><p>We know J.Law loves to joke around, but bragging about it may have taken it too far; “one rock that I was butt-scratchin’ on came loose, which prompted a landslide.” Sounds like she started a landslide for herself too after that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-she-speaks-about-her-love-affair-with-food><strong>When She Speaks About Her Love Affair With...Food</strong></h2><p>Something that understandably bothers the star is the criticism she has been subjected to for years now because of her weight, saying that Hollywood has pinned her as an obese woman. Though she has often spoke out against it, pleading for people to understand that there are many different body types, she also created a fine line between her argument and what she really stood for. Why? Because she became America's best friend for her pizza humor. Most people wanted J.Law to be their best friend, not because of her acting, but because of her love for food and how she adores stuffing her face. However, the reason she has received backlash for being "too much" was because, by being a star and talking about eating food very normally (since we all do as humans), it creates a divide&nbsp;between the star and the “normal” women who don’t permit themselves to indulge publicly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=j-law-gets-political><strong>J.Law Gets Political&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Not a big fan of social media, but a big fan of calling people out, Lawrence took to Facebook to address another issue, this time, against the White House. Again, she received backlash, mostly from Trump supporters who did not condemn her using her voice against him. She slammed the President by writing: “I pray for sanity and compassion to return to the White House.” She also said: “My broken heart goes out to the innocent lives of Muslim refugees that are trying to escape terror and find safety for their families.</p><p><strong>I and millions of Americans understand that someone's race or religion should never keep them in harm's way. It should be every person's duty to help and protect anyone no matter their nationality.”</strong></p><p>Because she has been very vocal about her disapproval of what's going on in the White House, many people insulted Lawrence, calling her "annoying" and "useless." Those comments must have come from Trump supporters who agree with how proper he is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=oops-she-did-it-again><strong>Oops...She Did It Again!</strong></h2><p>If J.Law does not mind giving the world the finger, then she definitely does not mind being improper when it comes to politics because it is a part of her “status” in Hollywood. And sometimes, maybe sometimes, Jennifer Lawrence is too good for her own good. After Trump won the election, we're not surprised J.Law made a broad and bold statement? Her disapproval of his victory led her to say that if she ever were to come face to face with the President, she would not hesitate for a second to throw and gash her martini in his face. Because J.Law does everything in good ol' fashion!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nYWp6tbXMnqpmopWju6qyxKtkpZmnp7Kvr8RmrpqrXam8sHnMrpqhZaSkeqmtzZ2jnmc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./alligators-freeze-again-in-north-carolina-swamp-with-noses-above-ice.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alligators freeze again in North Carolina swamp with noses above ice  WSOC TV">&larr;
