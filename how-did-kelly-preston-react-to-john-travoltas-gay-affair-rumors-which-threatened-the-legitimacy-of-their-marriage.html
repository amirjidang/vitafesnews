Sadly, tragedy struck the family when sixteen-year-old Jett suffered a heartbreaking accident in 2009, hitting his head on a bathtub while on a vacation in the Bahamas. This devastating event brought John Travolta and Kelly Preston even closer, as they leaned on each other for support during this difficult time. However, fate dealt them another cruel blow when Kelly Preston lost her battle with breast cancer in July 2020.</p><p>Throughout their marriage, like any other couple, Travolta and Preston faced their fair share of ups and downs.

Edwards claimed that Gotterba had informed her about his relationship with Travolta. Gotterba, however, chose to remain silent, neither confirming nor denying the allegations.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/john-travolta.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A man named Robert Britz, who reportedly dated Gotterba after his alleged involvement with Travolta, also spoke to the Enquirer, claiming that Gotterba ended the affair due to his dislike of Travolta's physical appearance. Britz alleged that Gotterba had confided in him about his relationship with Travolta in the 1980s, stating that Travolta would frequently make inappropriate advances.</p><p>Robert Britz claimed to have seen a video showing Travolta shirtless in a hotel room with food in front of him, indicating a personal and intimate connection between the two. Britz also alleged that their relationship reached a point where Gotterba felt overwhelmed, particularly by John Travolta's "hairy body" and weight gain between movies, which Gotterba described as making him 'huge.'</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/john-travolta.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"After a few years, Doug grew apart from John, and John's advances eventually started to repulse him," Britz shared. "The relationship ended shortly thereafter." Meanwhile, Travolta's stardom soared in the world of Hollywood.</p><p>Author Wensley Clarkson alleged that John Travolta's team went to great lengths to conceal his alleged homosexuality. According to Clarkson, they orchestrated a date between Travolta and rising star Brooke Shields.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/john-travolta-1.jpg><p>In his 1997 biography John Travolta: Back in Character, Clarkson recounts a pivotal moment when Travolta, during an interview with a magazine journalist, coincidentally received two affectionate phone calls from Brooke, fueling speculation about their relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Clarkson unveils the truth behind the rumors, stating that "close friends of John knew perfectly well there was no romance with Brooke. But the rumors certainly helped to improve John's image."</p><p>It is important to note that these claims are purely anecdotal and lack concrete evidence. Speculation and gossip about celebrities' personal lives are common in the entertainment industry, and often fueled by sensationalism. In the case of Travolta and Preston, these rumors have cast doubt on the validity of their relationship, despite the lack of substantial proof.</p><h2 id=kelly-preston-lashed-out-at-rumors-surrounding-her-marriage-to-john-travolta>Kelly Preston Lashed Out At Rumors Surrounding Her Marriage To John Travolta</h2><p>However, despite the swirling rumors surrounding her husband, Kelly Preston remained steadfast in her support. Opening up to a close friend, she expressed her frustration with the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">unscrupulous individuals seeking to profit from false allegations</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"There were some unscrupulous people who wanted to make money off her and John," recalled the friend.

However, over time, it became evident that Preston was preparing herself for a battle.</p><p>"Kelly would make comments like, 'It's really sad when people will destroy a family just to make some money,'" the friend recalled. "She was angry. She was like, 'You attack my family, and I'll come down on you. I will fight back every time.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Lisa Marie Presley And John Travolta Became Surprisingly Close (After Meeting When Presley Was 11)</a></span></p><p>Travolta and Preston appeared to address the speculations over the years. In a 2007 interview with W magazine, Travolta stated, "I have never felt compelled to share with you my bathroom habits or... my bedroom habits." When asked if the innuendo affected his career, he replied, "What affects your career is the quality of the product."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/john-travolta-and-kelly-preston-1.jpg><p>Preston, in a 1999 interview with the New York Post, expressed her frustration with the speculation surrounding their marriage, saying, "It pisses me off. Of all the condescending... [It's] just so insane. It's like, how do you respond to 'Somebody said you were having an alien's child?'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to several sources who regularly spent time with Travolta and Preston, they were a devoted and affectionate couple.

"I've heard her say, 'The last movie you chose was horrible!'" shared the friend, adding, "And then they'll laugh about it."</p><p>For Preston, falling for the romantic and affectionate Travolta was an easy choice. "John is definitely the greatest guy I've ever been with," she shared with Redbook in 2000. "I didn't want to be with a bad boy anymore, and I wanted to laugh. John and I both have really whacked senses of humor. Our best friends tease that we're the same person - we fly together, we go swimming, we love to just hang out."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmbalecqeo6WxXaW%2Fpr%2FTqKVmqpWWsLV506hko6eYo3q1vsCvpqWskah6qK3YZpifnpGev26%2B1Kamq6tdrLWqr8dmq6GqlZbBprrEnWStoJViuaazyK2gppmTrnqwsoytn56homK6or7RopignV8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-much-money-does-gordie-brown-make-latest-gordie-brown-net-worth-income-salary.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Much Money Does Gordie Brown Make?
