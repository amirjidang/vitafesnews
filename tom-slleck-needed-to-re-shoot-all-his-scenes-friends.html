In truth, this also held true off-camera, the main six were incredibly close. <span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>From This Perspective Friends Was Far Superior To Seinfeld</a></span>Along with a strong main cast, the show was also spoiled with some tremendous guest-stars along the way. We'll take a look at one of the most memorable, and the strong reaction he received.The truth is, despite the reaction, the veteran actor was very nervous to appear on the sitcom. Following such an ovation, we assume those nerves subsided at least a little.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=friends-had-to-make-a-few-edits-due-to-crowd-noise-over-its-10-seasons>Friends Had To Make A Few Edits Due To Crowd Noise Over Its 10 Seasons</h2><p>Like other sitcoms, Friends went through quite the editing process following the filming of an episode. Everything needed to be on point and that included the crowd noise. During certain scenes, if the crowd got too loud, it would take away from what the character had to say. In some instances the noise was lowered, while in other cases, the scene needed to be re-shot entirely.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>This Friends Guest-Star Said She Was Shocked By Her Emmy Award For Appearing On The Show</a></span></p><p>An average episode of Friends usually took five-hours to shoot. In addition, lines were at time changed on the spot during the shoot. Heck in some instances, the cast was told to make up a better line - Matthew Perry was known for his incredible wit on the show under these circumstances.</p><p>Jennifer Aniston also received quite the reaction to her "world's worst hangover" line alongside Ross. The moment got such a reaction that <a href=#>the crowd noise needed to be edited</a> due to how long the laughter lasted.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was a similar situation for a certain iconic Friends guest-star, who fans could not get enough of.</p><h2 id=tom-selleck-had-to-re-shoot-all-of-his-scenes-with-the-friends-audience>Tom Selleck Had To Re-Shoot All Of His Scenes With The Friends Audience</h2><p>The ovations likely made Tom Selleck feel a heck of a lot better, as the actor revealed <a href=#>he was incredibly nervous appearing on the show.</a></p><p>"I was scared to death," he said. "I had done Taxi a long time before, but I hadn't done a sitcom. And so, I was really nervous. Courteney helped a lot. Courteney's a big help. But that group's an incredible group of friends. They obviously became friends in life as well as on the show. And it shows. It was a wonderful place to work."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Tom Selleck Almost Walked Off His 'Rosie O'Donnell Show' Interview When A Touchy Topic Was Brought Up</a></span></p><p>Selleck further commented that at the table read, he wasn't in fine form like everyone else and in addition, it was tough to join a cast that already had such fantastic chemistry.</p><p>"I try to relax the new actors because that's really hard, to come on a show where everybody's up to speed. It's like when I did Friends," he said. "They were up to speed."</p><p>In truth, Tom really had nothing to worry about. His cameos on the show were very memorable, and he was among the best guest-stars. In fact, according to IMDb, <a href=#>it was hard for the live crowd to settle down whenever the actor was around.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"When Tom Selleck made his initial on-set appearances, he got standing ovations, which made his entrances unusable.

And I remember when we were doing a network run-through, the network and the producers would just laugh."</p><p>That person was none other than Fisher Stevens, who played Phoebe's critical boyfriend on the show. Stevens admitted himself to being harsh towards the cast and even apologizing for his behavior. "At that moment in my career, I had never done a sitcom before. I had never heard of Friends because it was just the beginning of the show and I didn't watch TV at the time much."</p><p>A shock to nobody, the actor was never invited back, unlike Tom Selleck's Richard character.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>The Cast Of Friends Blindsided Jennifer Aniston With An Intervention During The Show</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirqKVdqLmtscKkZKedlZmypXnTqGSrnV2otbC702aYpaRdnba0edKcnKedo2Kzs7XEp5usZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./8-reasons-why-tidal-flopped-as-a-streaming-platform.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="This Is Why Tidal Completely Flopped As A Streaming Platform">&larr;
