This startling revelation may not sit too well with Ashton's second wife, Mila Kunis, who has built a stable home life with her former That '70s Show co-star. Ashton and Mila have two kids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore got together, their romance got tons of media attention. People are still very curious about their relationship and how it fell apart. Demi was older, with kids. Ashton had never been married or been a father.

Maybe not. Ashton believed their marriage was an open relationship, according to Nydailynews.com, but Demi may not have wanted it that way.</p><p>She may have tried to keep her man by sacrificing her own needs. Those types of sacrifices tend to backfire in the long run.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=demi-thought-they-were-codependent><span class=item-num>19 </span><span>Demi Thought They Were Codependent</span></h2><p>Demi didn't get the love that she needed from her own mother, according to Refinery29.com. She said her mom actually sold her to a man when she was just a teenager.

Did Ashton help her to cope with the pain?</p><p>Demi has intense emotions. She's a Scorpio and her sign isn't compatible with Ashton's breezier zodiac sign, Aquarius. Any astrological combination can work, but Scorpios tend to do better with signs that are more emotional, such as Cancer and Pisces.</p><h2 id=demi-s-kids-stopped-talking-to-her><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>Demi's Kids Stopped Talking To Her</span></h2><p>When Demi got hooked on Ashton and went into major codependency mode, she alienated her kids. according to Mirror.co.uk.

The things is, Ashton and Mila's kids are little. They aren't anywhere close to being grown up.</p><p>Now, Ashton and Mila have to try and shield their daughter, Wyatt (aged 5) and son, Dmitri (aged 2) from stories about dad.</p><h2 id=ashton-s-reputation-was-damaged><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Ashton's Reputation Was Damaged</span></h2><p>Ashton doesn't seem super-stoked about Demi's bio and why would he be? He's already been branded a philanderer because of stuff that the public found out about him during his relationship with Demi.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, all of that, which he's tried so hard to put behind him, is being stirred up again.

Stars are always being photographed with their partners. Sometimes, those couple pics really tell a story.</p><p>During the marriage, Ashton began to look noticeably unhappy in some pictures, while Demi often smiled happily. Stuff was going on under the surface, according to Mirror.co.uk, and it wasn't all sunshine and roses.</p><h2 id=ashton-made-demi-feel-young-for-a-while-anyway><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Ashton Made Demi Feel Young (For A While, Anyway)</span></h2><p>It's not unusual for a romance to start out as a happy whirlwind and then turn into something much less stimulating.

Of course, she wouldn't own up to that, but Ashton may feel like he's getting hammered.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mila wants Ashton to fight back, according to Latintimes.com.</p><h2 id=mila-is-like-a-younger-version-of-demi><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Mila Is Like A Younger Version Of Demi</span></h2><p>Ashton has dated blondes, but his real type seems to be the sultry brunette with prominent cheekbones and hair parted in the middle.
