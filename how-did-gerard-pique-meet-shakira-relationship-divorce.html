It is unlikely that Shakira or Piqué will act like best friends anytime soon, but it was not always like this. In fact, if you think back to when they first got together, they were one of the most beloved Hollywood couples, and their relationship seemed close to perfect. So, what happened to make things go so horribly wrong?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-did-gerard-piqu-eacute-and-shakira-first-meet>How Did Gerard Piqué And Shakira First Meet?</h2><p>Shakira is a world-famous singer, and Gerard Piqué was an FC Barcelona star, so together, <a href=#>they were considered a power couple</a>. They first met in 2010 ahead of the world cup in South Africa. Shakira recorded the official song, and Piqué was one of the athletes to appear in her music video for "Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Why-Shakiras-Net-Worth-Might-Plummet-In-The-Upcoming-Years.jpg><p>Things were not romantic initially, as Shakira had been in a relationship with Antonio de la Rúa (they broke up in August 2010).</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Shakira Bought This Totally Over The Top Thing With Her Insane Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2011, it was time for Shakira and Gerard Piqué to make headlines again, confirming their relationship. In January 2012, they attended their first public event for Zurich's FIFA Ballon D’Or Awards. They never did get married, but this was not something Shakira felt they needed.</p><p>When asked in an interview with Glamour in 2014 if they would ever marry, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shakira quickly confirmed they were very committed to each other</a>. "We already have what's essential, you know? We have a union, a love for each other, and a baby," she told the publication. "I think that those aspects of our relationship are already established, and marriage is not going to change them. But if I'm ever going to get married, he's the one."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/gerard-pique-and-shakira.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They appeared to be incredibly happy until 2017 when there was speculation that their relationship was on shaky ground. This proved to be inaccurate, and at the time, a source told Us Weekly, "They have 100 percent not split."</p><h2 id=why-was-shakira-so-confident-that-she-and-gerard-piqu-eacute-would-be-together>Why Was Shakira So Confident That She And Gerard Piqué Would Be Together?</h2><p>During her relationship, Shakira was incredibly confident. She trusted that Gerard Piqué's love and commitment for her was enough, and she believed he was an "amazing man." If you ask her her current feelings on Piqué, the answer may not be quite the same.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who Is Worth More: Gerard Piqué Or Shakira?</a></span></p><p>"[Gerard is] with me because he wants to be with Shakira the person, not the celebrity," she told Latina magazine in 2014 (via Us Weekly). "There's real love, there's no ulterior motives. And I'm with him because he's the most amazing man I've ever met. We want the same things; we like the same things, we hate the same things. I have never been with someone so passionate in my life."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the time of the interview, they already had one child, their son, Milan Piqué Mebarak, who was born on Jan.22, 2013. It was clear that they were thinking of more.</p><p>"If it weren't for my music projects, I would be pregnant already [with a second child] I would love to have eight or nine kids with Gerard — my own futbol team," Shakira said. The couple did go on to have a second child, Sasha Piqué Mebarak, born Jan. 29, 2015.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/shakira.jpg><p>But they stopped at two, not nine. Despite this, the bond that Shakira felt with Piqué because they had children was intensified, and she told the publication, "When you have a baby, when you feel his love, you feel so at peace with the world…" Her comments are just a small glimpse into the happiness that they once shared.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In June 2022, it was alleged that Gerard Piqué had been unfaithful, and a few days later, they released a <a href=#>joint statement to the media to confirm that they would be breaking up</a>. "We regret to confirm that we are separating, they wrote. "For the wellbeing of our children, who are our highest priority, we ask that you respect their privacy." As far as celebrity statements go, this one lacked emotion, and it was maybe a teaser of what was to come…</p><h2 id=how-did-things-change-after-shakira-and-gerard-piqu-eacute-39-s-break-up>How Did Things Change After Shakira And Gerard Piqué's Break Up?</h2><p>No breakup is ever easy, but things are made much worse when the media attention on the subject is intense. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shakira addressed the breakup</a> in an interview with Elle in September 2022. She called it "her darkest hour." She also commented on how the attention their split received has made everything even more challenging, that and the fact that they share young children who she has wanted to protect from hurt as much as possible.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who Did Shakira Date Before Pique?</a></span></p><p>"I've tried to conceal the situation in front of my kids," she said. "I try to do it and to protect them, because that's my number one mission in life. But then they hear things in school from their friends, or they come across some disagreeable, unpleasant news online, and it just affects them, you know?"</p><p>She also commented on how the media had twisted the narrative. "And what's also real is the disappointment to see something as sacred, and as special as I thought was the relationship I had with my kids' father and see that turned into something vulgarized and cheapened by the media," she explained.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/shakira-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A month after this interview, she dropped a new song, "Monotonía," which appeared to have been, in part, a comment on her breakup. The former couple was able to come to a custody agreement, and then in January 2023, another new song "BZRP Music Session #53," was released in collaboration with Bizarrap. The lyrics hinted at someone being hurt by their partner's betrayal.</p><p><a href=#>Gerard Piqué is believed to be with someone new already</a>. Her name is Clara Chia Marti, and she is 12 years his junior. According to Insider, the song addresses this, with Shakira singing, "I'm worth two 22-year-olds / You traded in a Ferrari for a Twingo / You traded in a Rolex for a Casio."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmbalecaeqZqqlGK9qr3UnmSmnZWperS0wKSgq5ldp7KtrdOipqermJ69brDIr6arm5Vk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./gypsy-benitez-biography-age-net-worth-and-instagram-bio-aqib-talibs-wife-and-family.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gypsy Benitez Biography , Age, Net Worth And Instagram Bio: Aqib Talibs Wife And Family">&larr;
