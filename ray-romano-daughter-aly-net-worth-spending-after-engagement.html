Of course, Romano's family was portrayed on the show by many <a href=#>actors who got rich</a>, and one, <a href=#>Sawyer Sweeten, who tragically passed away way too early</a>.</p><p>However, even though Romano's real kids like Joseph Raymond Romano and Alexandra Romano, didn't star in the show, it felt like versions of them did. For that reason, many of Romano's fans still love it when<strong> </strong>the comedian talks about his kids, like when <strong>he called out his daughter's outrageous spending</strong>.</p><p>This article will look at Romano's comments about his daughter's spending. From there, it will look at <strong>how Romano learned his daughter was engaged</strong> and when <strong>he knew that his future son-in-law was going to propose</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ray-romano-called-out-his-daughter-after-she-got-engaged>Ray Romano Called Out His Daughter After She Got Engaged</h2><p>In April 2023, Ray Romano made an appearance on Live with Kelly and Mark. While talking to the show's hosts, Romano discussed the news that <strong>his only daughter is going to get married</strong>. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Romano then went on to quickly roast his daughter's spending habits</a> seconds after the big news came up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ray-romano-anna-scarpulla.jpg><p>"So much is happening this week. And then on top of that, my daughter sends me, you know, my movie's opening Friday. And she sends me a picture of her with a ring, and my wife and I go nuts. And then, all I could think is... I know my daughter. This movie has to make a lot of money this weekend.' I mean, The doves alone are gonna cost."</p><p>In response to Romano's joke about doves, the hosts and their studio audience laughed hard. Kelly Ripa then quickly asked Romano a follow-up question. "What's the budget for a wedding nowadays?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/malaak-compton-rock-has-been-slowly-putting-her-life-back-together-years-after-divorcing-chris-rock-after-his-cheating-scandal.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Chris Rock’s Net Worth Was Significantly Affected By His Rocky Divorces And Outlandish Spending Habits</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Chris Rock lost more money from his scandalous divorce than most people make in a lifetime.</span><p>During Romano's career, the wildly successful comedian has gained a reputation for being outspoken on almost any topic. After all, there aren't too many people who've spent years mocking their family in public like Romano did.</p><p>Fortunately for Ray Romano, his years of success as an actor and comedian have allowed him to become very rich. According to Celebrity Net Worth, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Romano has a $200 million fortune</a> as of February 2024.</p><p>Even though Romano usually seems like he will talk about anything, that clearly isn't true. Instead of even trying to answer Ripa's question, Romano just explained to the host that any number he might throw out would prove to be wrong.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ray-romano-looking-confused.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Yeah, I don't even know. You know what? I will be wrong. Whatever I say, I have no clue."</p><p>While Romano wasn't confident enough about a number to venture a guess about how much his daughter's marriage will cost, he was sure about one thing. According to Romano, he will pay whatever figure his wife of many years tells him to for his daughter's big day.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who is Ray Romano's wife</a>, according to People?</strong></p><ul><li><strong>She's from New York</strong></li><li><strong>The couple met while working as bank tellers</strong></li><li><strong>They got married in 1987</strong></li><li><strong>They have four kids</strong></li><li><strong>She survived breast cancer</strong></li></ul><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jpg_20230828_130756_0000.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Ray Romano Still Makes A Fortune From Everybody Loves Raymond But Do His Co-Stars Make Little In Comparison?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Ray Romano continues to make a fortune from Everybody Loves Raymond royalties but his co-stars may not be in the same boat.</span><p>"My wife is gonna tell me where to go and what check to sign, and that's gonna be the end of it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Romano pledged to spend whatever he had to for his daughter's wedding, Live with Kelly and Mark's newest host expressed his approval.

Based on those remarks, it may seem like Romano was taken by surprise to learn his daughter was getting married. However, it is clear that isn't the case.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ttweb_ray-romano-ridiculed-his-family-in-two-of-the-funniest-interviews-he-s-ever-done_bk_a1_v3.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before Romano's daytime talk show appearance, he revealed his daughter was engaged publicly for the first time during a previous interview. While talking to the radio host JC Fernandez, Romano told him that his daughter sent him the engagement photo only minutes earlier.</p><p>“While we’re on the subject of my kids.

Instead, Romano revealed more of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the backstory behind his daughter getting engaged</a>.</p><p>First off, Romano explained to Fernandez why his daughter didn't tell her parents about the engagement in person. According to the comedian, they weren't in the same city as their daughter at the time.</p><p>“Her boyfriend just proposed to her. We’re in Vegas and they’re in New York and she sent us this."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Romano then went on to explain that his future son-in-law had previously sought the comedian's approval. Despite that, Romano was surprised by the news that his daughter had gotten engaged because the original plan changed.</p><p>“He asked about two months ago, but he said he was going to do it in June. So he caught us by surprise, you know. I think he caught my daughter by surprise, but he's a good guy so we're happy."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipmrFdp7yurc2oZJ2ZpZy1tbHRZpilsV2jsrV51qipraBdqL2musOipaBlkZvBpr6MnqWgmZeauqa602g%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./redskins-name-change-works-129559.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Redskins Name Change In The Works?">&larr;
