It starred the likes of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kristen Stewart as Bella Swan</a>, Robert Pattinson as Edward Cullen, and Taylor Lautner as Jacob Black. The Twilight Saga focused on romance, battles, action, love triangles, werewolves, and obviously vampires! Everything about it was filled with ultimate intensity and passion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=p1><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s Why These Twilight Fan Theories Can’t Be True</a></span></p><p class=p1>The Twilight Saga was based on a series of books written by the brilliant and inspiring <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephenie Meyer</a>. She is an American novelist&nbsp;and her status as a bestselling author is beyond impressive. We love how she was able to put such an incredibly interesting story on paper for the world to consume. Unfortunately, some of the messages we learned about love from Twilight were all wrong. Here are some relationship mistakes we have learned to avoid while watching the saga.</p><h2 id=never-let-one-partner-call-all-the-shots><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Never Let One Partner Call All The Shots</span></h2><p class=p1>The first lesson&nbsp;about love that we learned from our time watching Twilight is to never let one partner in a relationship call all the shots. When one partner feels like they have more power and control over the other, the power dynamics are totally off. Things should feel equal between two people who are in love with each other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=p1>Two people who are dating should have each other‘s back and both should know that things are completely fair between them. If one person calls all the shots, then there is no way for things to be&nbsp;equal or emotionally healthy. Robert Pattinson agrees that there were some red flags about Twilight storylines and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he's spoken up about it</a>!</p><h2 id=jealousy-is-overbearing-and-unhealthy><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Jealousy&nbsp;Is Overbearing And Unhealthy</span></h2><p class=p1>Another mistake we learned while watching Twilight is the fact that jealousy in and of itself is overbearing and unhealthy. Jealous behaviors and antics are wrong and should be entirely avoided. Healthy relationships are built upon trust so when jealousy exists, it means that genuine trust most likely isn’t there at the level that it should be.</p><p class=p1>When two people are dating and they actually trust each other, they don’t really struggle with too many instances of jealous arguments or problems.&nbsp;Both individuals pretty much know that they can trust each other no matter what. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bella and Edward</a> did not always exhibit that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=people-shouldn-t-try-to-control-their-partner-s-friendships><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>People Shouldn't Try To Control Their Partner's Friendships</span></h2><p class=p1>People should not try to control their partner’s friendships. Everyone is entitled to have friends of their own, outside of their relationship. Just because a person has decided to engage in an exclusive relationship, it does not mean that they suddenly are not entitled to have their own separate friendships.</p><p class=p1>Having separate friendships is important because it is meaningful to have connections with other people outside of that romantic relationship. Without other friendships, a person can become completely consumed with who they’re dating. We saw this occur between Bella and Edward since Edward was uncomfortable with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her friendship with Jacob</a>.</p><h2 id=you-should-never-have-to-change-who-you-are-for-your-partner><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>You Should Never Have To Change Who You Are For Your Partner</span></h2><p class=p1>No one should ever have to change who they are for their partner! The bottom line is that Bella Swan actually became a vampire for Edward Cullen. She changed everything about herself down to the core of who she was as a human being. She was no longer a human in order to pursue her relationship with Edward.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=p1>Bella wanted to be with him forever and being with him in the long-haul meant that she couldn’t maintain her human form. She had to completely transform into a vampire for her relationship which seems really unfair. She lost everything about who she was and stopped being a person.</p><h2 id=encouraging-repressive-gender-norms-and-roles-is-wrong><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Encouraging Repressive Gender Norms And Roles Is Wrong</span></h2><p class=p1>Encouraging repressive <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">gender norms</a>&nbsp;and roles is wrong and that is something that we noticed a lot while watching the relationship between Edward Cullen and Bella&nbsp;Swan unfold. His old-fashioned views were really repressive. He often made her feel guilty and bad for wanting normal things that any teenage girl would want.</p><p class=p1>Bella's wants and needs word totally standard but for some reason, Edward always felt the need to make her feel guilty about her natural desires and urges. His repressive gender norms and ideologies seemed way too old-fashioned and messed up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=wanting-what-one-can-t-have-should-never-be-the-motivation><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Wanting What&nbsp;One Can't Have Should Never Be The Motivation</span></h2><p class=p1>When it comes to motivations within relationships, wanting what one can’t have should never be the deepest motivation! It seemed for a while there that between Bella Swan and Edward Cullen, wanting what they couldn’t have was motivating them the most.</p><p class=p1><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s How These Twilight Moments Should’ve Happened</a></span></p><p class=p1>The fact that they knew that their love was forbidden made them want each other even more. The idea of forbidden romance is passionate and intriguing so we definitely don’t knock them or judge them for feeling that way. But there needed to be more to it than just wanting what they couldn’t have.</p><h2 id=partners-should-never-abandon-each-other><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Partners Should Never Abandon Each Other</span></h2><p class=p1>Romantic partners should never abandon each other. This is something that should go without saying. In New Moon, Edward Cullen dipped out to try to keep Bella safe but in all reality, all it did was leave her in a deep depression. He abandoned her even though he claimed to love her and she did not know what to do with herself. This situation created the path of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">famous love triangle</a>&nbsp;between Edward, Bella, and Jacob so it was still a necessary plotline to the films.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=p1>Bella fell into such a depressed state of mind that she even felt suicidal and was willing to do things to hurt herself in order to feel closer to him again. When two people love each other, they shouldn’t abandon each other.</p><h2 id=watching-one-s-partner-sleep-is-creepy><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Watching One's Partner Sleep Is Creepy</span></h2><p>Watching one’s partner sleep is creepy… There’s no doubt about it. The fact that Edward Cullen would watch Bella Swan sleeping was always super weird, awkward, and creepy but since diehard fans of Twilight loved the couple so much, no one really spoke up on this issue or complained about it.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Photos That Remind Us Why Bella Should’ve Chosen Jacob Over Edward</a></span></p><p>Yes, we are aware that he was a vampire who was unable to sleep and that he still wanted to be close to her while she was sleeping but honestly, he should’ve just waited for hours of the day when she was awake so that they could actually interact with each other and talk.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=second-guess-before-dating-with-an-age-gap><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Second Guess Before Dating With An Age Gap</span></h2><p class=p1>Another love mistake we noticed while watching Twilight is the fact that Bella Swan and Edward Cullen jumped into a relationship without really thinking about their age gap. Edward Cullen was technically born in the year 1901, and even though his body was 17 years old when he met Bella Swan, his mind was&nbsp;way beyond&nbsp;that.</p><p class=p1>Edward was a fully grown man who had years of experience over Bella. She was 18 years old when she decided to become a vampire to be with him and she barely had any life experience under her belt when she entered into a relationship with him in the first place.</p><h2 id=bella-had-to-lie-to-her-parents-for-her-relationship-and-that-was-wrong><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Bella Had To Lie To Her Parents For Her Relationship And That Was Wrong</span></h2><p>Bella had to lie to her parents for her relationship with Edward and that is wrong. Anytime someone has to lie to their parents, friends, loved ones, or other family members in order to be in a relationship, it is usually a toxic situation. Bella had to lie in so many situations in order to carry out her relationship with Edward because she wanted to be with him so badly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a healthy relationship that doesn’t have any toxicity, lies are never necessary. People can always be fully honest with the people around them in their lives in regards to their romantic relationship.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s Why Anna Kendrick Felt Like A Miserable Hostage While Filming ‘Twilight’</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirsKGcnrSpwIyrppudoql6sa3TraCnq5%2Bjeqy%2ByKyrnqZdqMGmw8Crq2aqlaGutbXOp6qhoaBiuqq%2F05qinqtdobKivs2em2g%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./10-second-generation-wrestlers-who-were-better-than-their-parents-and-10-who-couldnt-live-up.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Second-Generation Wrestlers Who Were Better Than Their Parents (And 10 Who Couldn't Live Up)">&larr;
