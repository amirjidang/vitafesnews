When he was dating <strong><a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a></strong>, the two were photographed a lot by the paparazzi. This relationship came after Aniston's split from husband Brad Pitt.</p><p>The two broke up just one year later. While they have both complimented each other publicly, Vaughn admitted he didn't like how public their relationship was.</p><p>In 2010, Vaughn married Kyla Weber, a former real estate agent. Weber wasn't a celebrity and their union wouldn't attract the same level of media scrutiny. This was much more fitting for Vaughn, who eventually had two children with Weber.</p><h2 id=vince-revealed-that-he-didn-39-t-like-the-39-paparazzi-side-39-of-his-relationship-with-jennifer-aniston>Vince Revealed That He Didn't Like The 'Paparazzi Side' Of His Relationship With Jennifer Aniston</h2><p>Vaughn met Aniston when they were working on the film The Break-Up in 2005. The two actors co-starred in the 2006 romance and a romance blossomed in real life as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Their relationship lasted one year, with the couple announcing their split in December 2006. Not much was said by Aniston nor Vaughn about their relationship for a while. Then, in 2008, <a href=#>Aniston shared her thoughts on the relationship when speaking to Vogue</a>.</p><p>"I call Vince my defibrillator," Aniston, who met Vaughn the year she filed for divorce from Brad Pitt, told the outlet. "He literally brought me back to life. My first gasp of air was a big laugh! It was great. I love him. He’s a bull in a china shop. He was lovely and fun and perfect for the time we had together. And I needed that. And it sort of ran its course."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar29773408.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Vaughn kept quiet for a bit longer <a href=#>until he opened up to Playboy in 2015</a>. During the chat, Vaughn revealed that he wasn't a fan of the media attention the couple received.</p><p>"You know, she's great," Vaughn said. "For me personally—and I think most well-known actors who are together feel this way—I never enjoyed the paparazzi side of it."</p><p>Vaughn reflected on the role he played in the relationship, ultimately believing it paid off for him in the long run.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/vince-vaughn-has-been-dealing-with-a-disability-most-fans-didn-t-even-know-about.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Vince Vaughn Has Been Dealing With A Disability Most Fans Didn't Even Know About</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Vince Vaughn was frustrated about his condition growing up but it helped him succeed.</span><p>"You like someone and you're spending time with them; that's separate and that was all fine," he said. "But I really spent most of that time finding ways not to be drawn into the attention. I think lying low and not talking about it put me in a good position later, because I just wasn't part of anything."</p><p>Aniston went on to date Paul Sculfor and John Mayer. In 2015, she married Justin Theroux, with whom she co-starred in Wanderlust, and the two split in 2017.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=vince-married-kyla-weber-in-2010-and-has-chosen-to-keep-their-relationship-private>Vince Married Kyla Weber In 2010 And Has Chosen To Keep Their Relationship Private</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar47405774.jpg><p>According to Vogue, a movie producer and friend of Vaughn's introduced him to Weber at a wedding in 2008.</p><p>"I was nervous to date her because it's one of my best friends' wife's best friend from childhood," <a href=#>Vaughn said on Live! With Regis and Kelly</a>. "If it goes wrong, you're talking about awkward."</p><p>Weber worked as a residential real estate agent in Canada before meeting Vaughn. Her lack of connection to the celebrity world was a welcome change for Vaughn, especially following the very public relationship he had with Aniston.</p><p>"She's a civilian, which is good," Vaughn said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Vaughn proposed to Weber on Valentine's Day in 2009 and he later shared his feelings on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in 2011.</p><p>"Valentine's Day rolled around and I figured this is not a ship to be missed because I will not forget this date," he said. "So Valentine's Day was the day that I asked her. [It] worked out great because it would have been kind of weird to have talked about [getting engaged] and then skipped Valentine's Day as if who knows when this thing is coming."</p><p>"Sometimes, in our industry, well, I speak for myself – maybe that's an excuse – but you don't mature always at the same time, so I was very fortunate that when I got ready and was open to that, then that person came into my life," Vaughn reflected.</p><p>The couple were married in a ceremony with family and friends on January 9, 2010. The wedding took place at a historic mansion in Vaughn's hometown of Chicago.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I waited until I was a little older, and I'm glad," Vaugh told Playboy about marriage. "I just hadn't matured in that area. A lot of people think, 'Oh, I've got to focus on my career.' And then you wake up and go, 'Oh goodness, I forgot about the rest of my life.'"</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/snoop-dogg-revealed-things-got-tense-with-vince-vaughn-behind-the-scenes-while-filming-starsky-and-hutch.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Snoop Dogg Revealed Things Got Tense With Vince Vaughn Behind The Scenes While Filming Starsky And Hutch</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Things got real when Vince Vaughn slapped Snoop Dogg while filming Starsky & Hutch.</span><p>"Marriage is terrific, but it's the hardest thing I think you'll ever do," he continued. "You have to really work at it and want it. I got to an age when it was something that seemed exciting. I wanted kids and a family, but I wouldn't have at 30. You know how it is. You've been making decisions about what you're going to do on your own. Suddenly you're making those decisions with somebody else.
