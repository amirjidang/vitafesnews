Since they don't act anymore and don't seem to want to be famous, it makes sense that the <a href=#>Olsens don't want their children to be celebrities</a>.</p><p>Although Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen have chosen to keep to themselves, their many fans are still curious about the way that they live their lives, and that includes wondering about their family life. In this article, we'll take a look at <strong>whether Mary-Kate and Ashley get along with their parents David and Jarnie Olsen</strong>, along with what they have said about being child actors.</p><h2 id=inside-mary-kate-and-ashley-olsen-39-s-relationship-with-parents-david-and-jarnie-olsen>Inside Mary-Kate And Ashley Olsen's Relationship With Parents David And Jarnie Olsen</h2><p>Since <strong>Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen are so</strong><strong>private</strong>, they haven't said anything about their family recently. Whenever they are interviewed, which is infrequently, they talk about their fashion careers and don't mention their parents.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, based on the information available, the Olsen twins don't seem to think poorly of their parents. But, since they don't talk about them, people continue to question the relationship, especially since the twins didn't seem to like being child stars.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/mary-kate-and-ashley-olsen-claimed-they-wouldn-t-let-their-kids-become-child-stars-like-they-were-front-instar-back-the-ellen-show_youtube.jpg><p>According to People, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jarnette and David Olsen's <strong>1996 divorce</strong></a><strong> didn't seem to negatively impact the Olsen twins</strong>. Since Jarnette was at the Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony for the Olsen twins in 2004, it's possible to assume that she and the twins get along well. If they didn't, it's hard to imagine that they would want her there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/john-stamos-had-a-strict-rule-for-his-wedding-and-it-involved-banning-the-olsen-twins-front-back-deposit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>John Stamos Had A Strict Rule For His Wedding, And It Involved Banning A Pair Of Full House Stars</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>John Stamos had several reasons for banning Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen from his wedding, despite their history on Full House.</span><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Mary-Kate And Ashley Olsen's Family</p></th><th scope=col><p>Relation (According to People)</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>David Olsen</p></td><td><p>father</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Jarnette "Jarnie" Olsen</p></td><td><p>mother</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Courtney Taylor Olsen</p></td><td><p>sister</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Elizabeth Olsen</p></td><td><p>sister</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Jake Olsen</p></td><td><p>brother</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Trent Olsen</p></td><td><p>brother</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>According to People, David said "The girls are fine" when talking about the divorce, and he never mentioned that there was any trouble when speaking publicly. Ashley explained that she and Mary-Kate were working and not concerned with the divorce. But since the twins were encouraged to keep working at such a young age, it's hard not to wonder about what the situation was really like, especially since fans have heard that the twins didn't like being famous so young.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ashley-olsen-jarnie-olsen.jpg><p>While it's unclear how often Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen get together with their parents or how well they get along, they seem to love their sister Elizabeth Olsen. As Just Jared Jr. reported in 2021, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elizabeth spoke to TheOffCameraShow</a> and said that her twin sisters helped her put things into perspective as they had some wise words for her. It's interesting to note that Elizabeth mentioned their father David Olsen in this interview.</p><p>Elizabeth said:</p><p>“I think there are two things, something my sisters always say which might have come from my father at one point… it’s that ‘no’ is a full sentence. I really like that, especially as a woman. You can just say ‘no.’ I just really like that in all aspects of life."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Elizabeth said something positive about their father, it's possible to assume she has had a pretty good relationship with him. Like her twin sisters, she doesn't talk much about her parents in interviews. Whenever Elizabeth mentions her family, she only has praise for her siblings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar52801037-1.jpg><p>In a 2023 interview with The Financial Times, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen talked about The Row</a>, their impressive clothing line that they have been running since 2006. In the interview, the twins made it clear that they have put a lot of effort into their careers. They didn't mention their parents, and it's clear that <strong>they have done everything on their own</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/is-mary-kate-olsen-still-dating-john-cooper_-here-s-everything-we-know-about-her-secretive-love-life-after-her-rough-divorce-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Tragic Health Condition That Once Split The Olsen Twins</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Things got tough for the Olsen twins as soon as they turned 18.</span><p>Ashley said, “I mean, at 18, we decided to go to school and see what the world had to offer, and we started a company together in 2006, and have been in business for almost 20 years. I think everyone knows that this industry is extremely, extremely difficult. And we started with just the two of us… One step at a time. And MK and I have been running this business."</p><p>In The Financial Times interview, Mary-Kate also shared <strong>why they don't like to talk about themselves much</strong>. She said:</p><p>“We’re just private people. We’ve done interviews our whole life and, no offence, but I don’t know how this conversation is going to go. So after years of that, you just choose to stop talking to people if it’s not going to translate.”</p><h2 id=what-did-mary-kate-and-ashley-olsen-say-about-being-child-stars>What Did Mary-Kate And Ashley Olsen Say About Being Child Stars?</h2><p>Whenever Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen reflect on their childhood, they don't sound happy about it. Since they stopped acting when they got older, it's clear that they <strong>wanted to work in fashion</strong> instead of pursuing more work in Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While <a href=#>Mary-Kate has commented on the tough childhood</a> that she and Ashley experienced, Elizabeth Olsen told Interview Magazine that from her perspective, their family is pretty regular. She said, "I just think my family is so normal, but no one wants to accept that. I find my family to be normal because there’s an understanding of what every job entails. And it is a job."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/mary-kate-and-ashley-olsen-s-life-now-couldn-t-be-more-different-than-when-they-were-famous.jpg><p>What Movies Did Mary-Kate And Ashley Olsen Star In?</p><ul><li>To Grandmothers House We Go (1992)</li><li>Double, Double, Toil and Trouble (1993)</li><li>How The West Was Fun (1994)</li><li>It Takes Two (1995)</li><li>Billboard Dad (1998)</li><li>Switching Goals (1999)</li><li>Passport To Paris (1999)</li><li>Our Lips Are Sealed (2000)</li><li>Winning London (2001)</li><li>Holiday In The Sun (2001)</li><li>When In Rome (2002)</li><li>Getting There (2002)</li><li>The Challenge (2003)</li><li>New York Minute (2004)</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/elizabeth-olsen-and-robbie-arnett-s-marriage-is-a-secret-from-the-public-here-s-everything-we-know.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Elizabeth Olsen And Robbie Arnett's Marriage Is Top-Secret Aside From These Revelations</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Inside Elizabeth Olsen and Robbie Arnett's discreet romance: Secret elopements, British escapades, and a sapphire that spoke volumes.</span><p>In their 2021 interview with I-D Magazine, which was a big deal since the twins hadn't talked to the media in years, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen shared that they wanted to change careers and get away from child stardom. Ashley said:</p><p>“We had just moved to New York. We were 18 years old and I think what we did know was that we wanted to take that time to take a break from what we were previously doing and to explore things that interested us, and explore what life has to offer…”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/mary-kate-ashley-olsen-1.jpg><p>According to The Independent, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elizabeth Olsen opened up about her sisters</a> to Jessie Ware on the podcast Table Manners. She said:</p><p>“It’s weird growing up with that. The paparazzi part was the strange part because they follow you, and as a child it was very scary.
