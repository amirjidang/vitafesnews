Peta is an ex-model, actress and designer with her own lingerie label – launched in 2012. The beautiful actress is best known for La Femme Nikita – the TV series where she portrayed the character of Nikita. She has come on several TV shows like Highlander, Strangers, Two Twisted, Jonny Zero, The Finder, and CSI: Miami as a guest star.</p><p>The celeb actress has also worked on the big screen in productions like Superman Returns, Mercy, Beautiful, Gardens of the Night, and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Notable among Peta Wilson’s short moves are Errand Boy, One of Our Own, and Liberator. She was a one-time model and has bagged quite a few awards and nominations for her efforts in the world of entertainment.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=5-things-you-didnt-know-about-peta-wilson></span><strong>5 Things You Didn’t Know About Peta Wilson</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h4><strong>Birth Details and family background</strong></h4><p>Peta Wilson was born as Peta Gia Wilson in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia on the 18th of November 1970. She seems to be the only member of her family in entertainment as her dad; Darcy Wilson worked with the Australian Army as a Warrant Officer while her mother Karlene White Wilson earned a living as a caterer. Peta spent her formative years alongside one brother Rob Wilson who is employed in the Australian Army as a truck driver. Her parent’s union did not last long, ending in a 1982 separation.</p><h4><strong>Academic Qualifications</strong></h4><p>The only record of academic qualification for Peta Wilson is her high school graduation which she accomplished at an all-girls Catholic school located in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. However, the famed actress moved frequently during her growing up years, and I bet she will be the only Hollywood celebrity that spent eight years in Papua New Guinea. Though when the world of acting beckoned, she ended up in the studio of Arthur Mendoza – a Hollywood legendary acting coach.</p><h4><strong>Relationship History</strong></h4><p>The former model’s one known love relationship was with Damian Harris – a movie director of English origin with whom she cohabited from 1997 to 2002. At the end of Peta Wilson’s role as Nikita in 2001, she made the decision to go home to Australia to build her dream house, decompress, and give birth to the child she conceived with her lover, Harris. Her son, Marlowe Harris came in February 2002 and his birth tempered Peta’s impulse to jump right back into the Hollywood game. However, she couldn’t resist the offer to appear in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen alongside Sean Connery in 2003.</p><p>The designer and actress is still single till date and has never engaged in any past marriage with the opposite sex, perhaps she is one of those celebs with an aversion to the institution of marriage.</p><h4><strong>Body Statistics</strong></h4><p>The blonde bombshell stands at a height of 5 feet 10 inches or 1.78m weighing a matching 59kg or 130lb in body mass. Peta Wilson is the complete package with a slim body build, statuesque figure, deep sexy voice, ultra-intense blue eyes and well as natural blond hair. The star of La Femme Nikita has a bust line measured at 34 inches outlined by a tiny waist of 24 inches with her hip flaring out below at 34 inches. She wears a shoe size of 9 (US) and a dress size of 6 (US).</p><p>Peta Wilson also works hard to keep her body in tip-top condition, she is known to practice yoga, meditate, indulge in acupuncture and leverages on several alternative medicines to maintain a balanced physique. She is known to take on activities like swimming, cricket, gardening as well as painting.</p><h4><strong>Peta Wilson’s Designer Career</strong></h4><p>Another dream for the beautiful actress came to fruition in May 2012. She launched her own lingerie line called Wilye Wilson with the flagship store located in Venice, LA. From all indications, the Australian born model is going big in business and may not be lured to our screens again except if the offer is too hard to resist.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-she-doing-now></span><strong>What Is She Doing Now?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The question of what Peta Wilson is currently doing cannot be answered without mentioning her lingerie label which took off in 2012. Take off may have been a bit slow but the business is currently booming and Peta is fully into designing which is probably what took her away from the screen. As her customer base keeps increasing, the popular actress’s net worth is following suit as it was recorded in excess of $10 million at the last review.<br>However, Pet Wilson’s last on-screen appearance was in 2017 when she portrayed herself in Michael Hutchence: The Last Rockstar</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaG1dqbWqusasZLKnpWKxqrDNrWSkpp%2BseqKuzq6rZqiVqa5uw8ilqqimXay1osCMoqpmq5iaeqW7yKeeZqafrHpzew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./taylor-swifts-fashion-evolution-through-the-years.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A Look At Taylor Swift's Fashion Evolution Through The Years">&larr;
