Irish actor Liam Neeson and British actress Natasha Richardson have one of the most beautiful but&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cut short romances</a> ever. They might not have worked together in many of their films, but their meeting at Broadway would result in the two getting closer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Liam might not be as risky for movies that&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">require stunts</a>, but he&nbsp;has endured one of the most difficult times a father, husband, and friend could endure. Even after her passing, Liam has continued to work hard to honor his wife's memory as well as share some wholesome facts about their relationship.</p><p>Here's a throwback with Liam Neeson and the late Natasha Richardson's sweetest moments in their relationship.</p><h2 id=their-fateful-encounter><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Their Fateful Encounter</span></h2><p>Liam might be known for his memorable roles including&nbsp;Bryan Mills from the Taken franchise and Qui-Gon Jinn in the Star Wars prequels, but his resume includes theatre productions as well. He took part in the Broadway&nbsp;play, Anna Christie.&nbsp;There, he would meet Natasha, who played his love interest, while also debuting in Broadway with the play.</p><h2 id=the-attraction-was-kismet><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>The Attraction Was Kismet</span></h2><p>Despite being married to her first husband Robert Fox, Natasha and Liam definitely hit it off as if they were close friends. Their performances in Anna Christie were very outstanding, with their chemistry being fantastic and even earned them a handful of nominations.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Their attraction for each other might have been evident, but it happened during a strange time as Natasha was married to Robert and the marriage was&nbsp;on its last legs.</p><h2 id=following-her-divorce-with-first-husband><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Following Her Divorce With First Husband</span></h2><p>Natasha would eventually&nbsp;call it quits with Robert sometime in 1992, and even though their marriage was crumbling, rumors were spreading on the possibility of she and Liam having an affair. The two were close, but nothing really happened until around her 30th birthday. The interesting turn of events would lead to their relationship blossoming.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Facts About ‘The Parent Trap’ That Will Blow Any ’90s Kid’s Mind</a></span></p><h2 id=a-clever-but-adorable-reference><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>A Clever But Adorable Reference</span></h2><p>Once Natasha's 30th birthday rolled around, Liam was busy filming Schindler's List. But he took the time to send her a card and it read, "You're catching up with me. Lots of love, Oskar," which references the character he was playing in the critically acclaimed film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At first, Natasha didn't find the card and greeting romantic and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">once said to him as a reaction</a>, "This is like a letter from a buddy. What is our relationship?" This ultimately resulted in Liam falling absolutely in love with her, and that was the done deal for them.</p><h2 id=getting-married-a-year-after-their-first-meeting><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Getting Married A Year After Their First Meeting</span></h2><p>When Natasha asked that question to Liam, he knew that she was the one. After that moment, he once said, “That was when I knew I really loved this person. I thought, ‘This is real and genuine and is something that has to be protected.’” In 1994, the two&nbsp;tied the knot at their shared home in Millbrook,&nbsp;New York.</p><h2 id=their-first-son-miche-l><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Their First Son&nbsp;Micheál</span></h2><p>Not too long after their quiet, but beautiful wedding, the two would welcome their first son&nbsp;Micheál in 1995. Nowadays, he goes by with his mother's maiden name to honor her after her passing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If he was going to do something to pay tribute to her, taking her last name was one of the most endearing things he has done for his late mother. He faced difficult times and even went through alcohol abuse, but he took control of his life and focused on living his life for his mother's sake.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Actors Who Could Make A Better John Wick Than Keanu Reeves</a></span></p><h2 id=then-their-second-son-daniel><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Then Their Second Son Daniel</span></h2><p>In 1996, Liam and Natasha gave birth to their second son Daniel. Like his older brother, he went through hardships from losing his mother. Both had to grow up fast, but Daniel accomplished a lot, such as graduating from&nbsp;Tulane University and making a career out of fashion designing. He also has an Instagram and posts from time to time, and even shared some photos of him and his mother, recognizing her memory.</p><h2 id=things-were-going-very-well><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Things Were Going Very Well</span></h2><p>As a celebrity couple that just worked well together, things were going very well for Liam and Natasha. They were continuing their acting careers and being loving parents to their sons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before they became parents, the two&nbsp;starred in the 1994 film Nell, and it would be the only film they worked on together. And of course, they would star in their recognizable films such as The Parent Trap and Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace years later.</p><h2 id=and-then-tragedy-struck><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>And Then Tragedy Struck</span></h2><p>2009 was the year that changed everything. Before Natasha's tragic passing, she and Liam made a vow on what to do if one of them they were in a difficult situation. Liam stated in 60 Minutes with Anderson Cooper,&nbsp;“If any of us got into a vegetative state that we’d pull the plug. So when I saw her and saw all these tubes and stuff, that was my immediate thought.” Due to a skiing accident that resulted in a head injury, Natasha passed away.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Best 2000s Films To Watch (And Which Ones You Can Skip)</a></span></p><h2 id=revealing-sweet-secrets><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Revealing Sweet Secrets</span></h2><p>Natasha's life being cut short was without a doubt a heartbreaking occurrence for Hollywood and especially Liam and his sons. If there was some good that came out of this, Liam stated that Natasha&nbsp;had her organs donated.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So with her heart, liver, kidneys, three people are given another chance at life to survive. Commenting on this, Liam said in praises to his late wife, "It’s terrific…and I think she would be very thrilled and pleased by that."</p><h2 id=reflecting-on-the-good-times><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Reflecting On The Good Times</span></h2><p>Appearing on 60 Minutes with Anderson Cooper as the host revealed a lot about Liam's thoughts on Natasha during and after his time spent with her. Not only did he reveal a tough decision that had to be made if one of them were to be in a vegetable state, but also shared to the world that Natasha serenaded him at their wedding. She sang the song "Crazy Love" by Van Morrison and it blew him away.</p><h2 id=what-he-hopes-to-share-to-the-world><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>What He Hopes To Share To The World</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Starring in Love Actually</a> and&nbsp;having life imitate art was not something Liam could have expected many years later. Liam sadly had to grieve on losing the love of his life, but with that painful lesson, he shared an important message.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On social media, he told his fans to always cherish their partners and make every single moment count, even when the times are not good. Because of Natasha, Liam learned to have unconditional love and appreciate the time he got to have with her.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celeb Kids Who Refused To Follow In Mom Or Dad’s Footsteps (10 Who Caved)</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dqMSmsdOeqq1lnaS6prrTrGSipl2htqK5jKecnqufo3qiusNmpZqskai1onnRopqhmaKZwLC60mapnqSRqbawutKhoKln</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ties-dekker.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ties Dekker - Player profile">&larr;
