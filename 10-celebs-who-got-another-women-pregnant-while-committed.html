The reasons why some people choose to step outside of their relationships vary, but things can get even more complicated when the infidelity results in a pregnancy. This often evokes more of a sense of betrayal than simply having a brief relationship with a random stranger. Some women choose to forgive their partners, and even go on to marry them. Other women take the baby that the man has fathered as a sure sign that the relationship has come to an end.&nbsp; Then there are situations in which the mistress becomes the wife.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sometimes it can be quite easy for some women to make a clean break after they realize their partners have been unfaithful. Other women need to get a little revenge before they come to grips with the fact that the love they once had is no more. But apparently, it is possible in some cases to make peace with the fact that these things happen, and while the outcome is sometimes peaceful, it is anything but simple. Here is a look at 10 celebrities who impregnated a woman while they were in a relationship with someone else.</p><h2 id=10-future><b>10. Future</b></h2><p><a title="Future (Rapper) Net Worth" href=#>Nayvadious Wilburn</a>, known by his stage name Future, has a large family. His first child’s mother is Jessica Smith. Their son was born in 2002, and she filed for child support 10 years later, after a DNA test confirmed that the child was indeed Future’s. In 2012, Future fathered another child with Brittni Mealy. The following year, it was confirmed that he and singer <a title="Ciara Net Worth" href=#>Ciara</a> were in a relationship. In January 2014, it was announced that Ciara was pregnant with her first child—and Future’s <a href=#>fourth</a>. Ciara gave birth in May 2014. But a few months later, the two broke off their engagement due to Future’s unfaithfulness while on tour. It was later discovered that Future had never officially broken up with Mealy, and was traveling to Atlanta to see her frequently while he and Ciara shared a home in Los Angeles. There is currently speculation that Future and Mealy are now living as a couple again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=9-ginuwine><b>9. Ginuwine</b></h2><p>Ginuwine, whose real name is <a title="Ginuwine Net Worth" href=#>Elgin Lumpkin</a>, is the R&B crooner known for hits like “Pony” and “Differences.” He has recently teamed back up with fellow singer <a title="Tyrese Gibson Net Worth" href=#>Tyrese</a> and Tank, as the group TGT. Ginuwine met rapper Sole in 2009, and the two got married in 2003. Prior to the marriage, Ginuwine had a son named Elgin Jr., who was born in 1991. But he has also confirmed that he has three other children by three different women, in addition to the two daughters he has with Sole. It is unclear when the three children who are not Sole’s were fathered. However, it is speculated that at least one of the children Ginuwine has recently claimed to have with another woman was born during his marriage to Sole. Hopefully TGT will be touring again soon, since Ginuwine has a pretty penny in child support to pay, since he and Sole separated in 2014.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-francois-henri-pinault><b>8. Francois Henri-Pinault&nbsp;</b></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The CEO of Kering is known for his humanitarian work, but he also has a way with the ladies, apparently. <a title="François-Henri Pinault Net Worth" href=#>Pinault</a> was married from 1996 to 2004, and has two children from the marriage. In 2005, he began dating model <a title="Linda Evangelista Net Worth" href=#>Linda Evangelista</a>. The relationship ended in&nbsp; the beginning of 2006, but Evangelista gave birth to her and Pinault’s son in October of that year. She reported that Pinault had never supported the son they have together, due to the fact that Pinault doubted whether the child was his. In 2011, the two agreed to settle out of court. Also in 2006, Pinault started <a href=#>a relationship</a> with <a title="Salma Hayek Net Worth" href=#>Salma Hayek</a>. It is not clear whether all Pinault’s romantic ties with Evangelista were severed before he and Hayek became an item. It was reported in 2007 that Hayek was pregnant, and the two were engaged a month later. Their daughter was born in September 2007. They broke up in the summer of 2008, got back together, and renewed their vows in 2009.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=7-swizz-beatz><b>7. Swizz Beatz</b></h2><p><a title="Swizz Beatz Net Worth" href=#>Kasseem Dean</a>, known professionally as Swizz Beatz, has collaborated with several popular artists, including <a title="Chris Brown Net Worth" href=#>Chris Brown</a>, <a title="Lil Wayne Net Worth" href=#>Lil Wayne</a> and <a title="Jay Z Net Worth" href=#>Jay-Z</a>. But his personal collaborations have gotten him in trouble in the past. Beatz was previously married to singer Mashonda, and the two have one child together Kasseem, Jr. Dean also has a son with Nicole Levy named Prince, who was born in 2000. Mashonda and Kasseem were married in 2004, and announced they were <a href=#>getting divorced</a> four years later. Dean “went on” to have a daughter who was born in 2009. A Russian singer named Jahna Sebastian is her mother.</p><p>Swizz’s daughter with Sebastian was born the same year it was confirmed that Swizz Beatz and singer <a title="Alicia Keys Net Worth" href=#>Alicia Keys</a> were in a relationship. Rumors had been circling about their romance for about a year at this point, which indicates that Swizz’s daughter was born while he and Keys were in a relationship. The two married in July of the next year, and Keys gave birth to her first and Beatz’s fourth child, Egypt, in October of that year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=6-ludacris><b>6. Ludacris&nbsp;</b></h2><p><a title="Ludacris Net Worth" href=#>Ludacris</a>, whose real name is Christopher Bridges, has long been known for his radio hosting and rap skills. In his radio days, he was known as Chris Lova Lova, and lately, it seems that he’s been living up to his name. Ludacris has a daughter named Karma who was born in 2001. But he also has a daughter named Cai Bella who was born in 2013. Chris had been dating Eudoxie Mbouguiengue since 2009, and the child is not hers. Cai’s mother’s name is Tamika Fuller, who was apparently one of Ludacris’ old flames from his younger years. However, he and Eudoxie became engaged December 26, 2014, and got married a few days later. Ludacris and his wife are expecting a baby together later this year.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-dwyane-wade><b>5. Dwyane Wade</b></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a title="Dwyane Wade Net Worth" href=#>Wade</a> is currently a shooting guard for the NBA’s Miami Heat. But he’s clearly been making moves off the court as well. He married Siohvaughn Funches in 2002; the two were high school sweethearts. In 2007 he filed for divorce, but it took three years for the divorce to be granted due to lengthy legal battles. In 2011, Wade was granted sole custody of his two sons with Funches. He also raises his sister’s son as his own. In 2009, before his divorce was legally finalized, Dwyane Wade began dating actress <a title="Gabrielle Union Net Worth" href=#>Gabrielle Union</a>. Wade states that the <a href=#>two split</a> for a brief time in 2013, due to their hectic schedules. During the “break-up",&nbsp;he had a son with his longtime friend, Aja Metoyer. Wade and Union reconciled and married in August of 2014.</p><p></p><h2 id=4-chris-brown><b>4. Chris Brown&nbsp;</b></h2><p><a title="Chris Brown Net Worth" href=#>Chris Brown</a> has a reputation for being a womanizer, among other things. A few years ago, he was in a very public love triangle with singer <a title="Rihanna Net Worth" href=#>Rihanna</a> and model Karreuche Tran. After Rihanna decided that she had enough of the drama, Tran decided to try to stick it out with Chris. They broke up and got back together more times than we can count. Chris even released a video in 2013, stating that he felt like he was in love with two people, referring to Rihanna and Karreuche. But Rihanna has nothing to do with Brown’s latest scandal. It was revealed earlier this year that Brown has fathered a child with Nia Amey, while supposedly in an exclusive relationship with Tran. The baby is almost a year old, and Tran has stated that she doesn’t want any “baby drama”. Perhaps this may be the last straw for her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=3-sean-combs><b>3. Sean Combs</b></h2><p><a title="Sean Combs – Diddy Net Worth" href=#>Sean Combs</a> (aka P. Diddy, aka Sean John, aka Puffy, etc.) has almost as many monikers as he has children. Fortunately, there hasn’t been much negative press about him not caring for his offspring. He had a son with his high school sweetheart Misa in 1993 named Justin. He also had a son named Christian with his long-time girlfriend Kim Porter. Combs also legally adopted Porter’s son Quincy. The two also have twin girls together, D’Lila and Jessie, who were born in 2006. However, five months before the twins were born, Combs welcomed a baby girl named Chance with Sarah Chapman. He legally took responsibility for this child in 2007. It’s a good thing he’s worth millions.</p><p></p><h2 id=2-eddie-murphy><b>2. Eddie Murphy</b></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a title="Eddie Murphy Net Worth" href=#>Eddie Murphy</a> is the fourth highest when it comes to wealthy actors in the U.S. This is definitely a good thing, since he has lots of children to take care of. Eddie Murphy has five children with his ex-wife Nicole. The two lived together for almost two years before getting married in 1993. The pair met in 1988, but Murphy has a son who was born in 1989 and another born in 1990. Neither of these are Nicole’s children. It’s not clear how serious Nicole and Eddie were in their relationship when the two children were born, but they obviously went on to have a family together. After their divorce was finalized in 2006, Murphy started dating Spice Girl and X-Factor co-host <a title="Melanie Brown Net Worth" href=#>Mel B</a>. He doubted whether he was the father of the child until a DNA test in 2007 proved his paternity. The following year, Murphy had a commitment ceremony with <a title="Tracey Edmonds Net Worth" href=#>Tracey Edmonds</a>, the ex-wife of <a title="Babyface Net Worth" href=#>Kenneth “Babyface” Edmonds</a>.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-kelsey-grammer><b>1. Kelsey Grammer&nbsp;</b></h2><p><a title="Kelsey Grammer Net Worth" href=#>Kelsey Grammer</a> is known for his work on television, starring in popular sitcoms such as Cheers and the spin-off, Frasier. He is also a noted television producer, and a couple of his children have become actors as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kelsey Grammer has been married four times, and has six children and one grandson.&nbsp; When Grammer was married to <a title="Camille Grammer Net Worth" href=#>Camille Donatacci</a>, he fathered a child with the woman that would become his fourth wife, Kayte Walsh. Walsh and Grammer announced that they were engaged in December of 2010, but his marriage to Camille wasn’t legally over until February 2011. The baby Walsh was carrying in 2010 unfortunately didn’t survive. The couple have two children together; Faith, who was born in 2012, and Kelsey, born in 2014.</p><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=#>hollywoodlife.com,</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>dailymail.co.uk,</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>pagesix.com,</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>people.com</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZqaF2Ysq2xwaxksKCfYrSwwIyapaismJq%2FbsPOppynZaCnsqi6wKerZq%2BYnrmmecKopKahpKmypXs%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./best-hair-growth-serums.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="13 Best Hair Growth Serums">&larr;
