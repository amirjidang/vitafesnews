Since <a href=#>Cruise has headlined many movies that made a fortune</a> and <a href=#>Kidman is a blockbuster veteran</a>, it makes sense that they were such a big deal.</p><p>In Cruise's case, part of the reason he is so successful is how careful he is about his image. After all, <a href=#>Cruise has strict rules about how he looks in public</a> and he makes sure everyone knows about <a href=#>his most dangerous stunts</a>. However, Cruise once let his frustrations get the best of him when he told people who obsessed over his divorce from Kidman to "get a life".</p><p>This article will reveal why Tom Cruise told people who <strong>ask him about Nicole Kidman to "get a life"</strong>.

While this was far from the first time Cruise had been the subject of an article like that, this piece is noteworthy due to its timing. A little less than a year earlier, Cruise filed for divorce from Nicole Kidman. Due to the timing of that event, Cruise was asked about his divorce and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he told obsessed fans to <strong>mind their own business</strong></a>.</p><p>“I don’t care if it piques people’s interest. Honestly, people should mind their own damn business. And get a life of their own . . . . My personal life isn’t here to sell newspapers.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tom-cruise-told-an-interviewer-he-stepped-out-of-line-asking-a-question-about-nicole-kidman.jpg><p>Before Cruise got to the point where he seemed to vent his frustrations, Vanity Fair's interviewer Evgenia Peretz asked him a very personal question. "Why did you and Nicole decide to end it?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Vanity Fair's profile was published, that was a question that millions of people wanted answered. However, Cruise quickly made it clear that he wouldn't divulge anything specific about what led to his divorce at that time.</p><p>“She knows why, and I know why. She’s the mother of my children, and I wish her well.”</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/nicole-kidman-wasn-t-invited-to-her-daughter-bella-s-wedding-but-burst-into-tears-when-they-finally-reunited.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Do Nicole Kidman's Daughters Have A Relationship With Her Older Adopted Kids?&nbsp;">Do Nicole Kidman's Daughters Have A Relationship With Her Older Adopted Kids?&nbsp;</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Nicole's relationship with her oldest kids has been strained since her divorce from Tom Cruise.</p><p>According to Vanity Fair's article about Cruise, the movie star spoke "curtly" when he refused to say what led to his divorce. Cruise then went on to say that the best thing for him to do at that time was to <strong>move on with his life</strong>.</p><p>“And I think that you just move on. And I don’t say that lightly. I don’t say that with anything. Things happen in life, and you do everything you can, and in every possible way, and there’s a point at which you just sometimes have to face the brutal reality.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/tom-cruise-slammed-himself-during-an-interview-about-his-top-gun-contract-deposit.jpg><p>For a reporter to reach the heights of being employed by Vanity Fair and chosen to profile Tom Cruse, they have to be the kind of person who wants answers. With that in mind, it isn't overly surprising that Vanity Fair's writer didn't leave the subject after Cruise stated he was trying to move on.</p><p>Instead, Peretz stated that Cruise's comments made it seem like an event happened that led to the former A-list couple's divorce. However, Peretz also told Cruise that she recognized he may just be telling her to mind her own business.</p><p>Nicole Kidman Was Outraged To Be Asked About Her Marriage To Tom Cruise</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hugh-grant-lost-out-on-20-million-after-he-was-accidentally-offered-tom-cruise-s-role-in-jerry-maguire.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Hugh Grant Lost Out On $20 Million After He Was Accidentally Offered Tom Cruise's Role In Jerry Maguire">Hugh Grant Lost Out On $20 Million After He Was Accidentally Offered Tom Cruise's Role In Jerry Maguire</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Hugh Grant was very excited when he was sent the script for Jerry Maguire only to quickly be disappointed.</p><p>In response to both of those sentiments, Cruise restated that Kidman knows what happened, and he only wants the best for his ex-wife.</p><p>“No. I mean, she knows why, and she is the mother of my children, and I wish her well,”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/tom-cruise-and-nicole-kidman-from-eyes-wide-shut.jpg><p>At that point in the interview, Cruise told people obsessed with his divorce to "get a life". The last thing that Peretz asked Cruise which was related to his divorce was whether he looked back at the experience of making Eyes Wide Shut with Kidman differently.

That film focused on Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz's relationship behind the scenes of I Love Lucy. When The Guardian interviewed Kidman about the movie in 2021, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she was asked a question about Tom Cruise</a> that offended the beloved actor.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/nicole-kidman-admitted-_fears-and-insecurities_-about-her-looks-long-before-plastic-surgery-rumors-front-deposit-back-commons-licences.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title='Nicole Kidman Admitted To "Fears And Insecurities" Amid Plastic Surgery Rumors Backed By Doctors'>Nicole Kidman Admitted To "Fears And Insecurities" Amid Plastic Surgery Rumors Backed By Doctors</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Fans have accused Nicole Kidman of getting plastic surgery due to looking "unrecognizable" lately.</p><p>When Kidman was asked about how Being the Ricardos portrayed Ball and Arnaz's relationship, she gave a thoughtful answer.</p><p>"This film says you can make an extraordinary relationship thrive and leave remnants of it that exist forever. Yeah, that’s really gorgeous. You can’t make people behave how you want them to, and sometimes you’re going to fall in love with someone who isn’t going to be the person you spend the rest of your life with. And I think that’s all very relatable. You may have kids with them. You may not, but they were very much in love.”</p><p>In response to Kidman's answer, The Guardian's interviewer asked if she was bringing up her failed marriage to Tom Cruise. While the article doesn't reveal how that question was posed, the writer assures it was asked with "exquisite care".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Still, according to The Guardian's writer, Kidman "chokes just a little" at the suggestion before completely denying she was referring to Cruise. “Oh, my God, no, no. Absolutely not. No. I mean, that’s, honestly, so long ago that that isn’t in this equation. So no.”</p><p>Tom Cruise filed to end his marriage to Nicole Kidman in February 2001 which means they split up two decades before The Guardian interview. Kidman went on to marry Keith Urban in June 2006, which means the interview also took place more than 15 years after she got remarried.</p><p>After quoting Kidman, The Guardian's article states that she was "angry" to be asked about Cruise. The fact that Kidman called out the interviewer's question as "almost sexist" proves <strong>how outraged the actor was</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“And I would ask not to be pigeonholed that way, either. It feels to me almost sexist, because I’m not sure anyone would say that to a man. And at some point, you go, ‘Give me my life. In its own right.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirqKVdmL%2B2tdKeZKehk6S5pnnKopummZ5isarCzquanmWmlruqwNhmnZqhomK2r8DEq62inadk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./toy-boy-season-3-renewed-or-cancelled.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Toy Boy Season 3: Renewed or Cancelled?">&larr;
