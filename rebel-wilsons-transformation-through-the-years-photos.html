I don’t know why. Maybe because people find it easier to laugh. It’s very hard to laugh at someone who’s very attractive, I think.”</p><p>In fact, Wilson even <a href=#>gained weight to pursue comedy</a>. “I don’t know if it was megaconscious, but I thought, ‘How can I get more laughs? Maybe if I was a bit fatter,’” she recalled to&nbsp;The Telegraph&nbsp;in July 2016. “And then suddenly I was fatter and doing comedy.”</p><p>However, as the actress’ career skyrocketed, she changed her perspective, revealing in May 2020 that she hoped to slim down. “Even if you have to <a href=#>crawl towards your goals</a>, keep going x it will be worth it. Try and give a little bit of effort each day,” she wrote via Instagram at the time. “I know some days are frustrating as hell, you feel like giving up, you get annoyed at the lack of progress … but good things are coming your way.”</p><p>Wilson added: “I’ll be honest with you guys — with my ‘Year of Health’ mission, I’m trying to get to 75kg’s.” The Australia native noted that her aspiration was “requiring a daily effort,” filled with “constant setbacks,” but she was still “working hard.”</p><p>As for her fitness regimen, her personal trainer <strong>Gunnar Peterson</strong> shared her secrets in March 2019. “She is crushing!” he told&nbsp;Us Weekly&nbsp;exclusively. “<a href=#>Never misses [a workout]</a>. Comes in even on travel days and right when she gets back. She is locked in!”</p><p>Peterson then detailed her routine. “Lots of strength work with dynamic intervals spliced throughout,” he explained. “Think sled work, Technogym’s SkillRun treadmill with sled and parachute protocols, focus mitts, moving kicks to pads, rope work, vertical rope work, sledgehammers. … Any and everything to keep her body guessing and her mind engaged!”</p><p>Two years later, Wilson opened up via Instagram about how the death of her late father impacted her eating habits, recalling she was in “so much pain” and “use[d] food to numb my emotions.”</p><p>“I look back now at that girl and am so proud of what she’s become and achieved,” she wrote at the time, sending words of hope to anyone dealing with food issues. “[I] just wanted to send out some encouragement to everyone out there struggling with weight or body issues or emotional eating. I feel you. I know what it’s like.”</p><p>In summer 2022, the Australia native not only<a href=#> announced her relationship</a> with fashion brand owner <a href=#><strong>Ramona Agruma</strong></a>, she also shared several photos of herself in swimsuits while the two vacationed across Europe.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>A source exclusively told Us in July 2022 that “Rebel’s not working with a trainer day-to-day anymore to lose more weight as she’s reached her goal.” Instead, the insider noted, “She’s focused on maintaining the weight she’s lost and <a href=#>feeling comfortable in her skin</a>.”</p><p>Scroll down to see Wilson’s transformation through the years!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58sbXCrayrnaNkv6auxKVksKGcqLyvv4ytqZqmo5u8s7nAraCopl2ptbO71KCfZqyYmnq6scCrqmaomKTBsL%2BO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./richard-gilder-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Richard Gilder Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography">&larr;
