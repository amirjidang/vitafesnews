Luckily, several cutting-edge <a href=#>gaming PCs</a> are created to deliver great gameplay despite the game you choose.</p><p>Moreover, people in this world are very tech geeks; they work day and night to make every wire look uniform and nice. At times the case is so small that they get perplexed how large loops fit in there. But the best thing is they never give up. This group mostly has gamers who are also known as creators. These creators are enthusiastic about building high-end gaming PC. Deep inside, they know that a day will come when all of their hard work will be paid off, and this piece of <a href=#>technology</a> will do miracles.</p><p>To date, these skilled people have successfully built the most expensive gaming computer in the world. Let’s have a glimpse at it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>8Pack OrionX: Most Expensive High-End Gaming PC</h2><ul><li>Price: £29,999.99 ($41,519.96)</li></ul><p>At the moment, 8Pack OrionX is the world’s most expensive gaming PC Or two PCs since you get two systems in one case, both remarkably powerful and more than able for anything from gaming to other powerful computational workloads. Whatever you want it for, the ORIONX2 is a powerhouse of a system.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are a gamer and have been fantasizing about a perfect <a href=#>high-end gaming PC all your life</a>, the great <a href=#>news</a> is this is your dream gaming PC. By any chance, if you have £29,999.99 ($41,519.96), forget about throwing an extravagant party, do not take a flight to the same destination every other month, rather pay the amount in something you love. Something no one else’s possesses. Follow your fantasies and be the owner of the most expensive gaming PC ever.</p><p>At the start of the year 2017, this beauty recognized as 8Pack OrionX came out in front of the whole world out of a clandestine lab. Its single case called<strong> Phanteks Enthoo Elite</strong> alone costs $949. This single case has a giant-sized machine inside itself. The machine is created of two different systems. The processor’ <strong>10-core Intel i7-6950x’</strong> is used to strengthen the higher-end system. However, the other secondary system is powered by a less expensive processor known as <strong>Core i7-770K</strong>.</p><p>A very successful computer builder named <strong>Ian Parry</strong> and the incredibly talented designer of the machine showed the list of the components used to make this most expensive gaming PC. It’s just unimaginable how Parry managed to pack so much computing power in an ordinary-sized case. His work deserves a big round of applause.</p><p>Total graphics cards equipped on the computer are four; each graphics card is worth $1,900. The most amazing part is that the total gaming memory of those cards is equal to 48 GB. A normal portable computer is implemented with a total of 8 GB of memory; now you must be able to see the prominence of this high-end gaming PC. The primary memory present in the 8Pack OrionX is 64 GB, whereas on the secondary system, it’s 16 GB.</p><p>There are three different storage setups present on the primary computer. The first one is a hard drive ‘1.2 TB Intel 750’, the second storage setup comes with two 1TB Samsung Evo 850 SSDs and the third one is a hard drive called <a href=#>10TB SATA</a>. You can also download the internet with the second storage system’s help as it is equipped with 512 GB Samsung 960 SSDs.</p><p>The cooling loops are established wisely; they seem highly professional and work unusually by keeping everything inside at a standard temperature. These liquid loops are three in number and are customized especially for the system. Moreover, there are a large number of LEDs as well.</p><p>You might be considering OrionX is also another model like many fancy car automakers fool people with. However, it is not a prototype, and it is not just a remarkable concept made to catch the headlines. It is certainly a reality. The world has finally got its most expensive gaming PC. This is ready to be sold out to gaming lovers. No doubt at £29,999.99 ($41,519.96) OrionX is the most expensive PC present in this world. It is not like any other conventional PC; it’s more beneficial than all. It is extremely fascinating because it is built by a very excellent and famous system builder. The majority of the components of this 8Pack are customized, and the best part is that a single chassis holds two incredible premium quality systems. Each of the systems has high-speed hardware. One of the systems is ideal for usage at the workstation, while the other is suitable for gaming.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vizaca.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Most-Expensive-Luxurious-Gaming-PC.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading>OrionX2 Specifications:<strong></strong></h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Primary system:<strong></strong></h3><p>CPU: Intel Core i9-10980XE 4.6GHz (overclocked) | GPU: 2x Nvidia RTX Titan 24GB | RAM: 128GB | Storage: Dual 2TB SSD + 14TB HDD</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Secondary system:<strong></strong></h3><p>CPU: Intel Core i7-10700K 5.0GHz (overclocked) | GPU: Nvidia RTX Titan 24GB | RAM: 32GB | Storage: Dual 2TB SSD in RAID 0 + 14TB HDD</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>System Features:<strong></strong></h3><ul><li>Two systems in one, both with extremely powerful hardware</li><li>18-core, 36-thread CPU on the primary system and 8-core, 16-thread CPU on the secondary</li><li>Optional up to four Nvidia RTX Titans</li><li>128GB of RAM on the primary system</li><li>Water cooling on both CPUs and the primary GPU</li></ul><h3 class="has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading">Technical Specifications (E-Atx Primary System)</h3><ul><li>Specially customized Phanteks Elite Full-Tower with integrated reservoirs and 8Pack logos</li><li>Cool interior with LED lighting, cable sleeving and coloured liquid coolant</li><li>Custom water cooling with EKWB components and three independent custom loops</li><li>Custom OC & water cooled Intel Core i9-7980XE (Skylake-E) with 18 Cores (36 Threads!!), 24.75 MB L3 Cache and OC @ min. 4.6 GHz</li><li>ASUS ROG Rampage 6 Extreme Omega Mainboard (E-ATX) with Intel X299 chipset and LGA 2066/li></li><li>Two water cooled NVIDIA RTX Titan with 24GB GDDR6 VRAM connected in NV-Link for incredible gaming graphical performance, or three water cooled NVIDIA RTX Titan run independently for computational/rendering operation.</li><li>Faster and more efficient DDR4-RAM with 128 GB capacity and 3200 MHz clock frequency or 64GB running at 3600MHz</li><li>2TB Samsung 970 Evo NVMe-SSD as the primary storage device</li><li>2TB Samsung 970 Evo NVMe-SSD as the secondary data storage</li><li>Huge 14 TB Seagate HDD for tertiary data storage</li><li>2.000 Watt Super Flower Leadex 8Pack Edition Power supply with extreme performance & 8Plus Platinum efficiency</li><li>Perfectly applied Thermal Grizzly Hydronaut thermal compound</li><li>Additional: Comes with Windows 10 Professional pre-installed</li><li>Custom water cooled Intel Core i7-9700K (Coffee Lake) with 8 cores, 12 MB L3 Cache, and overclocked to at least 5.0 GHz.<br>Or Intel Core i9-9900K, 8 Core, 16 Thread Overclocked to at least 4.8GHz</li><li>ASUS ROG Strix Z390I Gaming Motherboard (Mini-ITX)</li><li>Rapid DDR4-RAM with 16GB capacity at an unbelievable 4000 MHz clock frequency</li><li>Exceptional graphics card: NVIDIA RTX Titan with 24GB GDDR6 VRAM</li><li>Two lightning-quick and reliable Samsung 970 Evo M.2 NVMe SSDs with 2TB, configured in RAID 0 as the primary storage devices</li><li>A huge 14 TB capacity Samsung HDD for secondary storage</li></ul><p>Additional: Comes with Windows 10 Professional pre-installed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vizaca.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Expensive-Game.png><p class=has-medium-font-size><strong>What do the systems have?</strong></p><p class=has-medium-font-size>Even though they are distinct in most of the hardware, they have two things – the case and the power supply. The case might seem like a one-off, but it’s a Phanteks Enthoo Elite, an outstanding full tower case that has been greatly customized by Ian 8Pack Parry, to get a different look, as well as to be able to provide the powerful components that go inside.</p><p>The case itself is enhanced by RGB lights as well as a few carefully placed logos that let you know exactly what you are looking at.</p><p>The power supply in question is an 8Pack edition Super Flower Leadex. When you think of the components inside, you might be wondering how they strengthen both systems at once. The answer is simple – this is a 2000W PSU with an 80+ Platinum certification that uses a power splitter to deliver the necessary power to both systems. It is incredibly strong and potent. 8Pack used custom cables by Pexon PCs in the UK to make sure the power cables look subtle, too.</p><p>The primary system, a real powerhouse:</p><p>There is no doubting that both systems are great, but it’s the primary, E-ATX one that takes the cake as the “<strong>better</strong>” of the two, both due to the choice of components and the individual attention that has been paid to building the entire thing.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Motherboard</h3><p>At the core of the primary system sits the LGA2066 socket ASUS ROG Rampage 6 Extreme Encore. It’s ASUS’s top-of-the-line motherboard, and it comes with something such as an excellent VRM section, up to four M.2 drives, excellent networking and audio sections, and Wi-Fi 6. It has eight DIMM slots as well, which is an integral part of the system.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>CPU</h3><p>In that LGA2066 socket sits <strong>Intel’s Core i9-10980XE processor</strong>. This is an 18-core, 36-thread processor that Intel made for the most advanced scenarios and is the most expensive 10th generation Intel CPU.</p><p>It comes with 24.75MB of L3 cache, which is excellent, but it’s the frequencies that are unbelievable. Intel ships this CPU with a base clock of 3.0GHz, and a maximum turbo of up to 4.6GHz.</p><p>This is pretty remarkable in itself, but in the OrionX2, 8Pack pushes this to a minimum of 4.6GHz. You will be getting a firm CPU, without any stability problems, and the performance is as great as it gets.</p><p>This hits the question, how does that chip stay cool when pushed so hard? The explanation is the custom cooling solution made with three independent loops and the Thermal Grizzly Hydronaut thermal compound. The loops’ components are all by high-end brands – EKWB, Aqua Computer, and Mayhem, and they are all top-of-the-line choices.</p><p>The case provides for integrated reservoirs, and one of the highlights of the case is the reservoir shaped like the 8Pack logo. There is also all the custom work, like the acrylic plates that you will not find for sale outside the system, and the outcome is a system that not only stays cool under load but looks surprising while doing so.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>GPU</h3><p>It’s not just the CPU and NVMe that are water-cooled – the GPUs are, too. And in the case of the OrionX2, you are looking at two Nvidia RTX Titan graphics cards, connected with NV-Link so you can merge their power for gaming. If, however, you need the primary system for rendering or other computational tasks, you have the option to work with three independent RTX Titan GPUs. In any case, they are a part of the cooling loop, and the performance you will be getting out of them is truly exceptional.</p><p>This dual system has a triple custom water cooling loop, it is explained by Overclockers UK as:</p><p><strong>“A total of three independent loops are responsible for cooling, all of which are managed by their own Aquaero 6 from Aqua Computer, thereby enabling them to be conveniently controlled. The CPU, as well as the NVMe drive of the E-ATX system,</strong> are cooled by a 480 mm radiator as well as a 360 mm radiator. Visually, these two loops can be recognized<strong> by their grey and silver liquid coolant. The CPU of the Mini-ITX system on the other hand is cooled by a 360 mm radiator, the loop of which can be identified by its red coolant. The uniqueness of this water cooling setup, however, undoubtedly lies in the unusual design as 8Pack – apart from utilising premium components from EK Water Blocks, Aqua Computer and Mayhem – has also designed his own unique components,</strong> especially for the OrionX2. For this reason, the liquid coolants are guided through the whole system thanks to various custom acrylic plates, ultimately presenting themselves in the large reservoir in the shape of the 8Pack logo where all the liquid coolants and pumps finally come together. An absolutely unique show which is unrivaled<strong> in every respect including not only design and performance but also for its extremely quiet functioning.”</strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Memory</h3><p>Memory, both RAM, and storage, is well taken care of. You get the option between 64GB and 128GB of RAM, both running at 3600MHz, but the lower capacity kit has somewhat better timings. It is a matter of individual choice, and in any case, you will not be lacking. In terms of storage, you get two 2TB Samsung 970 EVO NVMe SSDs, one for primary storage and secondary storage. And yes, Overclockers UK and 8Pack agree that 4TB might not cut it for some, which is why they add a Seagate IronWolf PRO 14TB mechanical hard drive, too.&nbsp; The entire system is built to look even better thanks to the BitFenix Alchemy 2.0 LED lighting strips, and at the bottom, you are looking at a PSU shroud that has a few logos that quickly show what you are looking at. Not only is it a real powerhouse for gaming and working, but it’s a beautiful build, too.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Beauty & Lightning Features</h3><p>The interior of this enormous beauty is recommendable; every part of it is packed with fantastic lightning, fan grills, or customized coolants mostly made for the cooling system. An Intel i7-6950x alone costs $1,365.</p><p>On the other side, there are four graphics cards called <strong>Nvidia GeForce GTX Titan X</strong>, which is worth $4,400.</p><p>Other components include a 16 TB of HHD storage and a 1 TB Samsung 850 Pro SSD. To guarantee that all of the PC components do not get very hot, Kylaralthor has set twenty-six fans inside. Besides that, there is also a customized liquid cooling setup to make sure the system does not heat up.</p><p>Some of the other accessories are three 27-inch 1080p monitors, and all of them are even worth seeing. In addition to that, the wireless headphones, keyboard, gaming mouse, and 4 TB external drive are also high-quality. 4.4 GHz is used to overclock the 10 core CPU i7-6950X, the Intel’s flagship also has <strong>liquid cooled</strong> graphics cards. The very fast Intel 750 PCI-E SSD has 1TB; you also get a remarkable memory of 64 GB and SSD storage space of about 3.2 TB. More than 2,000 MB/Sec data can be dished out easily. The computer’s secondary system has an excellent motherboard located at the base; it is identified as Asus ROG Strix Z270I Gaming mini-ITX. This system has 16 GB RAM, 5.1 GHz. overclocking is done by an Intel i7-7700K. Apart from that, an Nvidia GeForce GTX Titan X graphics cards are also there.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Beauty & Lightning Features</h3><p>The interior of this enormous beauty is recommendable; every part of it is packed with fantastic lightning, fan grills, or customized coolants mostly made for the cooling system.

This system has 16 GB RAM, 5.1 GHz. overclocking is done by an Intel i7-7700K. Apart from that, an Nvidia GeForce GTX Titan X graphics cards are also there.</p><p>The total volume of storage in both the systems of this high-end gaming PC is simply exceptional, it is 24 TB. The SSD based storage is 4 TB, whereas each hard disk has 10 TB. You must be questioning the purpose behind the two systems. The idea is quite apparent while your workstation is involved, you can still enjoy gaming on the other system. You can also use the other system to check videos or photos while resuming your work on the first system. The best thing is a single power supply is used to power both systems.</p><p>The real show stopper of this most expensive gaming PC has to be the recommendable cooling system. It is so amazing and unique that it is specially made for OrionX; moreover, it’s a customized cooling system. It’s obvious for the 10 core CPU to heat up quickly, so to prevent it from overheating the computer has two radiators to cool it. Furthermore, the smaller system and the graphics cards have their own radiator.</p><p>Other than the cooling system, another kicker in OrionX is its excellent graphics cards. We all know that gaming PCs are incomplete without a good graphics card. The builder of this gorgeous beast didn’t forget that. They made sure this department was also taken care of; unlike traditional gaming PCs, this one is equipped with four Nvidia Titan X Pascal graphics cards. Those cards are spread all over both the systems.</p><p>Many of you might not know that Nvidia Titan X Pascal is one of the most potent and high-quality graphics cards available on the market. It is swift, and per card, there is 12 GB of video RAM. Atop it is so great that the company had to limit the number of cards sold per customer. Now an individual can buy only two of these graphics’ cards. Keeping that in mind, you may know that OrionX has four such graphics cards.</p><p>As seen, the 8Pack Orion X is a strong gaming PC that packs two systems in a single unit. The primary system is perfectly united for intensive workloads like computational operations or rendering, while the second caters to the gaming crowd. It is no surprise the Orion X ranks as the world’s most expensive gaming PC.</p><p>It is obvious that only a few people can afford this classic. However, if you are a gaming professional or a PC lover, then checking it out will bring great pleasure.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC5zqyrZp2opbKvv8ivnGafkaK2r7OMqZpo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./30-rock-star-dean-winters-in-pain-after-two-amputations-what-we-know.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'30 Rock' Star Dean Winters Is In Pain After Two Amputations: Here's What We Know">&larr;
