He has been fighting on the top platforms for over a decade since making his professional debut in 2010.</p><p>Not only in his senior career, but Jose also has an incredible amateur career to boast about. He was the national champion eleven times and also qualified in the junior Olympics on top of making the US national team list.</p><p>As he continues to impress the audience with his abilities inside the ring, it has won the hearts of many people. The limelight again fell on the fighter amid his match against Danny Garcia.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-jose-benavidez-jr-wife-heather-lopez></span>Who Is Jose Benavidez Jr Wife, Heather Lopez?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>American boxer Jose Benavidez Jr is together with his partner, Heather Lopez, for a few years now.</p><p>Lopez is a social media personality known as the lover of the boxer and has a good fan following on Instagram. However, her professional life details remain a mystery as there is no hint about it on the internet.</p><p>Jose and Heather have been together for at least three years as the lady shared their first photo in 2019. Although they are pretty jubilant, whether the couple has tied the knot remains unknown.</p><p>They have two daughters, Amora Juliet, born in 2020, and Delilah Jane, in 2022. Other than them, Lopez seems to have a daughter from her previous relationship.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jose-benavidez-jrs-brother-david-benavidez-is-also-a-boxer></span>Jose Benavidez Jrâ€™s Brother, David Benavidez, Is Also A Boxer<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jose Benavidez Jr has a younger brother, David Benavidez, who is also a professional boxer.</p><p>He is a two-time WBC super middleweight champion and held the title from 2017 to 2018 and 2019 to 2020. David is the youngest WBC super middleweight title holder in its history after winning the title match at only 21 years, eight months, and 22 days old.</p><p>In fact, the 25-year-old fighter is currently the number one ranked super middleweight boxer in the world by The Ring. Likewise, other critics, such as Transitional Boxing Ranking Board and BoxRec, rank the fighter in second and fourth positions, respectively.</p><p>The age gap between the siblings is five years old as the older sibling is 30 years old.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jose-benavidez-jr-family-details></span>Jose Benavidez Jr Family Details<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Discussing his family, Jose Benavidez Jr was born to a boxing trainer father, Jose Benavidez Sr, and an Ecuadorian mother.</p><p>Nothing much about her mother is available on the web, while his dad is a recognized trainer. However, any further background on his parents, such as their personal life details, is missing from the internet.</p><p>His parents, brother, wife, and children make up his family. They share a close bond and are often spotted together on various family and celebration occasions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK2WmHqru9KeZJudnpbDqrDEs2Sjql2btqi006KloGWfrLturtGoq6GdomKxosLInWSbnZ6Ww6qwxLNkraeUlsZuucSeq2agmah6uLXFnmSfmZ2eubp7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-happened-to-jonathan-mangum-is-he-sick-accident-and-health-update-452906-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Happened To Jonathan Mangum?
