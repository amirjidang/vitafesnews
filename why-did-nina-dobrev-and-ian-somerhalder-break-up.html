Following the announcement of their split, fans immediately began to wonder what could've happened between the two.</p><p>A source shared that the break-up might have been caused by the age difference between the actors. According to Us Weekly, a source said, "I think <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she decided she wanted to experience other things</a>." A source also explained, "The relationship kind of brewed out of a friendship and the fact that they had to get into a romance for the show."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Somerhalder was 34 and Dobrev was 24 at the time, so it does make sense that perhaps they were interested in different things for their futures, considering a decade difference does add up.</p><p>According to Nicki Swift, people believe that while <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Somerhalder would have gotten married, Dobrev didn't want to do that just yet</a>. The website also noted that when Somerhalder started seeing Nikki Reed, they announced their engagement six months after they began seeing each other.
