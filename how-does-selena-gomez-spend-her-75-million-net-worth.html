And for good reason, as she feels like a regular girl who people can relate to.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">celebrity crush on Shia LaBeouf</a>&nbsp;to her breakup from Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez is always honest and open about her life. And while some stars are pretty hush-hush about the ways that they spend their money, that isn't the case with the pop singer and actress.</p><p>Gomez has a net worth of $75 million and she has made a lot of interesting (and fabulous) purchases over the years. Let's take a look at how Gomez spends her money.</p><h2 id=4-9-million-mansion>$4.9 Million Mansion</h2><p>Gomez has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">achieved a lot since breaking up with Bieber</a>&nbsp;and one thing that she has done is buy a very expensive house. This is definitely a rite of passage for a young pop star or actress, as it proves that they have officially made it in Hollywood and can now live in luxury. This is most likely the largest purchase that Selena Gomez has made in recent years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gomez <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bought Tom Petty's $4.9 million mansion</a> in spring 2020 and it was big news. The house has an incredible backyard with a peaceful place to sit and relax and an amazing pool. According to Elle.com,&nbsp;there are 10 bathrooms here, six bedrooms, and the house is more than 11,000 square feet. Tom Petty and Jane Benyo, his wife, moved into this house in 1989 and they had the house built so it was exactly what they wanted.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s Why Justin Bieber And The Weeknd Once Feuded Over Selena Gomez</a></span></p><h2 id=300-an-hour-pilates-classes>$300 An Hour&nbsp;Pilates Classes</h2><p>According to&nbsp;E Online, Selena Gomez also spends her millions on a very pricey gym membership. She enjoys Hot Pilates classes that set her back $300 for each hour.</p><p>The equipment includes resistance bands and weights, and the studio is 95 degrees. A source told&nbsp;E Online&nbsp;that Gomez has seen&nbsp;many benefits since attending these classes, and it's important for her to work out, as she has struggled with her mental health in recent years.&nbsp;Fans are familiar with Gomez's health battles&nbsp;as she got a kidney transplant and also has lupus.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Amy Rosoff Davis has been Gomez's personal trainer for a while and she was interviewed by&nbsp;Byrdie.com&nbsp;about Gomez's exercise schedule. She shared,&nbsp;"[My first priority when training Selena is] listening to her body—which everyone should do when it comes to working out. Sometimes we just do yoga and stretching, and sometimes we hit it hard. Working out, just like life, should be a balance."</p><h2 id=private-planes>Private Planes</h2><p>There are many stars who fly on private planes when going on vacation or heading somewhere for a business meeting, and Gomez is part of that club, too.</p><p>According to an&nbsp;Us Weekly&nbsp;article from December 2017, Gomez and Bieber flew on a private plane to Seattle. They had a romantic date and according to&nbsp;TMZ, they went to the Sugar Factory, a candy store.</p><h2 id=a-lavish-birthday-bash>A Lavish Birthday Bash</h2><p>Gomez <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">threw The Weeknd a $30,000 birthday bash&nbsp;</a>in 2017.&nbsp;While the party happened in L.A., Gomez was in NYC at the time and, according to&nbsp;Nicki Swift, she made sure that The Weeknd had her credit card&nbsp;so she could cover everything.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to&nbsp;Teen Vogue, stars such as Travis Scott and Big Sean were at the party, and it took place at Dave & Busters in Hollywood.&nbsp;The party guests had the place all to themselves from 11 at night until two in the morning.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Selena Gomez Speaks Out On The Misrepresentation Of Martin Luther King</a></span></p><h2 id=many-homes-filled-with-antiques>Many Homes Filled With Antiques</h2><p>Gomez also is a big fan of antiques and, according to&nbsp;Nicki Swift, she said, "I love trinkets and memorabilia and antiques." She has talked about buying special things for her houses.</p><p>Yup, Gomez has had more than one home over the years, so real estate is one way that she spends her millions.&nbsp;According to&nbsp;People.com, she had a home in Calabasas that she sold for $3.3 million in 2016. It has three acres of land, a movie theater, and also a gym.</p><p>People.com&nbsp;also reported that in 2018, Gomez was trying to sell her house in Texas, and she kept lowering the price.
