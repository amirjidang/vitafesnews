But not every star makes a ton of money from their product line. For example, fans are curious <a href=#>if Kylie Jenner is having money problems</a> because of Kylie Beauty.</p><p>While <a href=#><strong>Friends</strong></a> star <strong><a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a></strong>'s hair line might not seem super different at first glance, it's more affordable than many, which makes it stand out. According to CNN,<strong> Aniston created a new product called The Sculpting Paste </strong>for her hair line LolaVie, and it came out in April 2024. While Aniston's products aren't as pricey as fans might expect, she still could make good money from selling this product.</p><p>In this article, we'll take a look at <strong>how Aniston's hair care line might add to her net worth</strong>, along with some background on when and why she started the company.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-aniston-could-add-to-her-net-worth-thanks-to-her-hair-care-line-lolavie>Jennifer Aniston Could Add To Her Net Worth Thanks To Her Hair Care Line LolaVie</h2><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, <strong>Jennifer Aniston has a $320 million net worth</strong>, and it seems likely that she will grow her net worth from her hair care company LolaVie. The products have become increasingly popular over the past few years, and Aniston's fanbase was clearly eager to buy whatever the star was selling.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/despite-being-anti-plastic-surgery-jennifer-aniston-has-gotten-these-procedures-2.jpg><p>It's interesting to note that Aniston's LolaVie products are super affordable. While fans might think that they would each cost at least $100, that's not the case at all. The Sculpting Paste, for example, only costs $29.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While <strong>it's unknown what Jennifer Aniston earns from her hair care line</strong>, she could be bringing in some big bucks. According to Forbes, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rihanna became a billionaire because of her Fenty Beauty line</a>. Forbes also noted that in 2018, Fenty Beauty's profits totaled $570 million. It's also unclear how much money LolaVie makes, but Aniston has called the brand successful in many interviews. The low price of each product is definitely attractive since that makes it easy for fans to buy the products time and time again instead of feeling like they are splurging or have to save up for months.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/jennifer-aniston-friends.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>A Friends Guest Star Admitted He Was Shocked When Jennifer Aniston Gave Him The Okay To Appear On The Show</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Given their awkward history, Jennifer Aniston thought a Friends guest star was joking when he revealed his cameo on the show.</span><p>In 2022, Jennifer Aniston told Forbes that customers have been really happy with LolaVie, which proves that she must be making money from it. She sounded thrilled about how the line has been doing.</p><p>She said:</p><p>“Well, we’ve had such an incredible reaction from our consumers, so that’s probably the most satisfying. We won eight beauty awards and we had multiple five-star reviews and it just feels that the work we put into this product and the time we took, all of these products, has paid off.
