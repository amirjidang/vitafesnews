The young wrestler took NXT by storm when he undertook the Velveteen Dream persona, having a natural ability to draw attention and catch the imagination of fans. From unteachable charisma to great in-ring work, Dream was certainly on the rise to the point where he was pegged to be a future World Champion by many - including John Cena. Then, it all came crashing down.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TNA-The-10-Biggest-Debuts-In-Company-History-featured-image.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>10 Wrestlers Who Still Got Pushed Despite Major Controversies</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Controversies often occur in wrestling.

Well, now Dream is once again being talked about in the internet wrestling community, and it’s not because of another controversy or apology video. This time, it’s because of his in-ring return – something most fans didn’t think would happen, especially because of how bad of a reputation he had gotten among the viewers. <strong></strong></p><h2 id=velveteen-dream-was-on-his-way-to-becoming-a-star-prior-to-allegations>Velveteen Dream Was On His Way To Becoming A Star Prior To Allegations</h2><h3 id=wwe-still-kept-him-around-for-a-year-before-releasing-him>WWE Still Kept Him Around For A Year Before Releasing Him</h3><span class=txt>Close</span><ul><li><strong>Velveteen Dream is 28 years old</strong></li><li><strong>Worked for WWE from 2025-21</strong></li><li><strong>A former NXT North American Champion</strong></li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Velveteen Dream made his first foray into WWE when he competed in the Tough Enough competition. He was instantly a hit despite not winning, and he was soon signed to a WWE contract. After a few stop and start gimmicks, he became “Velveteen Dream”, who looked to draw inspiration from the likes of the musician Prince and legends such as Rick Rude, though it came with its own flavor and charm. <a href=#>With feuds against the likes of Aleister Black, Ricochet, Tommaso Ciampa</a>, and more, he became a permanent fixture in the upper card of NXT.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/best-wwe-nxt-feuds.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>10 Best Feuds In WWE NXT History, Ranked</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Out of all the great feuds that have happened in WWE NXT over the years, these ten have been the absolute best thus far.</span><p>Dream’s rise was huge, and it felt like it was just a matter of time before he moved up to the main roster to continue his ascent to superstardom. He went on to battle the likes of Johnny Gargano, Adam Cole, and Matt Riddle, though following his return from injury, he was one of the many wrestlers named and called out during the Speaking Out Movement. This saw many brave individuals speaking against mistreatment, assault, and more that they had experience in professional wrestling, airing the quite disturbing side of the industry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the case of Dream, there were allegations thrown his way regarding explicit images sent to underage boys and girls, though Dream firmly denied these allegations in a now deleted tweet (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">h/t Fightful.com</a>), stating, “Be assured I did not communicate inappropriately with anyone. A private photo of mine was shared without my consent or knowledge and I am working with a third party to look into this matter.” A WWE investigation didn’t draw any conclusion of him doing anything wrong. Either way though, this put his name in a bad light, and fans were hesitant to react to him, regardless of whether he was a babyface or a heel. He was eventually taken off TV, and <a href=#>then released following nearly half of a year of not competing</a>.</p><h2 id=velveteen-dream-was-arrested-twice-in-a-week-in-2022>Velveteen Dream Was Arrested Twice In A Week In 2022</h2><h3 id=he-had-previously-been-arrested-in-november-2021>He Had Previously Been Arrested In November 2021</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Velveteen-Dream-WWE.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He later became involved in another controversy. In August 2022, Dream was arrested twice in the space of just a few days, indicating that he was going down a darker path following his exit from the wrestling industry. The first instance involved battery, as he was accused of punching a gym owner, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">with Wrestling Observer reporting</a>, “He was charged with two counts of misdemeanor battery and trespassing on a property after receiving a warning. The charges were eventually dropped, however, the alleged victim said he did not wish to prosecute.”</p><p>Dream managed to escape any sort of punishment here, but it didn’t take long for him to be once again thrust into the news with a second arrest, this time just six days later when he was arrested on possession of drugs, though there has been little information on this story, indicating that any charges may have been dropped also. Recently, the footage of his arrest <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was released by TMZ</a>, which shows him in quite a hysterical state, shouting at police officers and accusing them of wrongdoing in terms of his arrest.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It hasn’t just been arrests which has thrown Velveteen Dream’s name into further controversy, as even more allegations were directed towards him via EC3, who accused Dream of setting up a camera in the bathroom of his house during a party. Dream once again came out to deny any of this, giving his side of the story and stating that there are those currently in WWE who would corroborate his story. Of course, all of this is a “he said, she said” type of thing, so it is hard to make any judgment. One thing was for sure though, and that was that Dream’s name was far from what it once was, and his legal issues after being released from WWE have put him in an even worse light.</p><h2 id=velveteen-dream-made-his-wrestling-return-after-3-years>Velveteen Dream Made His Wrestling Return After 3 Years</h2><h3 id=won-his-match-against-alec-odin>Won His Match Against Alec Odin</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Velveteen-Dream-NXT.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On February 17, 2024, Velveteen Dream made his return to a wrestling ring. He is now known as Velveteen Man instead. This happened during a Dynasty show, where he faced Alec Odin. His appearance caused backlash from fans again, as the promotion that brought him did not announce his return prior to the show. Some fans are especially taking issue with Dynasty’s “family-friendly pro-wrestling” tagline, due to Velveteen’s past. The promotion later <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">issued a statement</a> and said that they stood by their decision to give this wrestler another chance.</p><p>“Last night, we did what most others wouldn’t. We took a risk on a person, & gave them an opportunity for a 2nd chance. A 2nd chance to fulfill their DREAM. We stand by that decision.</p><p>Thank you to the PACKED house for last night’s event! #WearetheDynasty”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This was not the first time Velveteen tried to return to the ring. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In July 2021</a>, SWF Wrestling announced him for their Home Sweet Home show in September, but after receiving criticism from fans online, he was pulled from the show.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmenrLJuwsSlrZ6slZq7brDRnpimZaKauaat0p5kq52kqr%2Bvew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-illness-does-john-kruk-have-fans-are-worried-about-his-health-condition-380879-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Illness Does John Kruk Have?
