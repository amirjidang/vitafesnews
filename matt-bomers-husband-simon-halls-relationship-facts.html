But away from the camera, Bomer's life is quite different to these sinister on screen personas. The handsome&nbsp;star enjoys a wholesome relationship&nbsp;with his husband, <strong>Simon Halls</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>aRelated: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celebs Who Look The Same (But Aren't Related)</a></span></p><p>While many celebs love to flaunt their lavish weddings and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PDA-packed romances</a>, Bomer prefers to keep his love life low-key.&nbsp;Unbeknownst to many fans, the actor has been with his husband for&nbsp;over a decade and the couple shares an unwavering bond despite Bomer's immense success. Here's everything we know about their low-key relationship.</p><h2 id=they-ve-been-together-for-a-long-time><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>They've Been Together For A Long Time</span></h2><p>Sadly, it seems to be rarer and rarer to hear of long-lasting celeb relationships these days. So many couples who seemed perfect for each other <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">have broken up</a>, but Matt Bomer and his husband, Simon Halls, are among the few whose love is enduring.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The pair first met in 2008 when Simon was hired as Matt's publicist. Their connection was instant and they began dating.</p><h2 id=simon-is-a-hollywood-big-shot><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Simon Is A Hollywood Big Shot</span></h2><p>He may seem like a pretty understated guy, but Simon Halls is in fact a Hollywood publicity mogul. His A-list clients include the Coen Brothers, Jude Law, and Sarah Jessica Parker. What's more, he managed the Oscar campaigns for acclaimed movies such as Gladiator, American Beauty, and Brokeback Mountain.</p><p>He even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">worked for Hillary Clinton</a> during the 2016 presidential election. With Simon's publicity portfolio and Matt's acting resum√©, there is no doubt that these two are a Hollywood power couple.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=their-marriage-was-initially-kept-a-secret><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Their Marriage Was Initially Kept A Secret</span></h2><p>Not all celebs want to lead their lives&nbsp;as open books. In 2011, Matt and Simon got married, but they decided to keep it a secret until 2014. Like a number of other celebs, the couple decided to have a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">small, private wedding</a>, with just a few friends and family in attendance.</p><p>Opening up about the legalization of gay marriage to Out magazine in 2014, Matt said, "There's a security, a validity of knowing that it's legal."</p><h2 id=they-have-3-kids-together><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>They Have 3 Kids Together</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When the couple first met, Simon already had a 3-year-old son, Kit. In a W Magazine<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">profile from 2008</a>, Simon was one of several gay single dads asked about their experiences of surrogacy.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stars That Celebrated Father's Day For The First Time In 2021</a></span></p><p>However, Kit, now aged 16, is blessed to have a second dad as well as two siblings: twins Walker and Henry, born in 2008. As the 3 kids all share Simon's surname, it is unclear whether he and Simon were an item at the time of the twins' birth.</p><h2 id=matt-credited-simon-and-their-kids-with-his-decision-to-come-out><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Matt Credited Simon And Their Kids With His Decision To Come Out</span></h2><p>In 2012, Matt came out as gay. He told Out magazine that his husband and sons were instrumental in his decision to live his truth: "I felt a responsibility to Simon and to our kids to be able to live with integrity and and not have some strange split psychology of, 'This is who my dad is at home, and this is who he is&nbsp;to the public.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-couple-has-quite-a-big-age-gap><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>The Couple Has Quite A Big Age Gap</span></h2><p>As hard as it may be to believe, Matt Bomer is in his 40s. Despite his agelessness and immaculate appearance that makes him look at least a decade younger, he is in fact 43. Meanwhile, Simon is 57-years-old. While that is by no means among the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">biggest celeb couple age gaps</a>, it's still a significant age difference.</p><h2 id=they-won-t-let-their-kids-watch-matt-s-tv-shows-or-movies><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>They Won't Let Their Kids Watch Matt's TV Shows Or Movies</span></h2><p>From American Horror Story&nbsp;to Magic Mike, Matt Bomer hasn't exactly&nbsp;acted in a lot of family-friendly content. Accordingly, Matt&nbsp;and his husband won't let their kids watch&nbsp;his&nbsp;TV shows and movies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Real Life Partners Of The Cast Of 'American Horror Story'</a></span></p><p>"I just have to make sure that I start working on more things that they can see!" the actor told ET. "Cause they're like, 'You do this, but then we can't watch it.' I'm like, 'When you're older maybe!'"</p><h2 id=the-couple-is-fiercely-private><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>The Couple Is Fiercely Private</span></h2><p>Matt and Simon like to maintain a degree of anonymity. Although Matt occasionally discusses his husband in interviews and sometimes posted photos of&nbsp;the two on&nbsp;Twitter a few years ago, he rarely divulges information about his family&nbsp;on social media these days.</p><p>Moreover, Simon himself keeps his&nbsp;personal&nbsp;life to himself and has a private Instagram account with just over 1,000 followers and no profile photo.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-welcomed-their-son-when-he-came-out-as-straight><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>They Welcomed Their Son When He Came Out As Straight</span></h2><p>In 2019, the couple's eldest son, Kit, revealed to his dads that he is straight. Describing the moment as sweet, Matt told RuPaul about the couple's reaction to their son <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">coming out as straight</a>. "He's 14. He said, 'I love and respect that you guys are who you are. I'm straight, that's how I identify.' And it was a big, nice, sweet moment," the actor explained, later adding that he and and his husband "would be there with open arms."</p><h2 id=this-is-the-key-to-their-successful-marriage><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>This Is The Key To Their Successful Marriage</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Elders are often our biggest and wisest inspiration and Matt learnt the key to a successful marriage from his grandparents.</p><p>"My grandparents were together from the time they were teenagers on, and I used to ask them and they'd tell me, 'One day at a time,'" Matt told ET. "So, I guess I try to adapt that philosophy, but also just having perspective. You know, at the end of the day, the family and our home life is the most important thing and keeps everything else in perspective."</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's What Matt Bomer Really Thinks Of Lady Gaga</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikmqykYq%2BwucSrqmagpaivorrDZqqipZ%2Bjeqmty6WqZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoGKzoq%2FTrGY%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./punky-meadows.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Punky Meadows dating?
