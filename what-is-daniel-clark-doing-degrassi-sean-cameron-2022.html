Prior to the afternoon Canadian teen soap, Daniel had been a successful child star with roles in <a href=#>Fox Kids' Goosebumps </a>and Erie Indiana: The Other Dimension. He also did eight episodes of My Best Friend Is An Alien. But Degrassi was his big break... And it was also his last big role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite appearing in 101 episodes of Degrassi: The Next Generation (as well as 13 Degrassi: Minis), Daniel chose not to pursue a career in acting. He took a number of small roles while starring as bad boy Sean Cameron, but he seemingly abandoned the profession when his time on Degrassi came to an end. This has caused many fans to wonder what happened to him as well as other <a href=#>Degrassi stars who've vanished from the spotlight</a>. Many of <a href=#>Degrassi's stars such as Drake and Nina Dobrev</a> have gone on to have incredible careers. Daniel has to, it's just not the career he started with. In fact, his new life is incredibly normal...</p><h2 id=what-happened-to-daniel-clark>What Happened To Daniel Clark?</h2><p>During <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with Conventional Relations</a> about his time playing Sean Cameron on Degrassi: The Next Generation, Daniel explained how he was living his life in 2020. Other than pictures on his Instagram, Daniel has mostly gone radio silent since his time on Degrassi. But this interview revealed that he and his partner, Mandee, live in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Both Daniel and Mandee are business owners in Canada. He runs a real estate company and she runs Sparks Candles, a bespoke candle company that creates clean-burning products for businesses and homes. According to his Instagram, it seems Daniel has quite a hand in Mandee's company as he does his own. He even helped her alter her business practices when the pandemic hit.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How A Music Video Saved 'Degrassi: The Next Generation' From Cancelation</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We’ve had to pivot with her company to focus more on the E-commerce component to try and find these customers online in lieu of coming to our brick and mortar store or in lieu of a lot of the events that are just not happening this year," Daniel Clark said to Conventional Relations in 2020, when the global COVID-19 pandemic was in its early stages. "So that’s been a mixed bag, but we’re kind of on the upward swing. The real estate company just kind of went on because everyone still needs houses."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Think This Was The Most Shocking Moment On 'Degrassi'</a></span></p><h2 id=will-daniel-return-for-the-degrassi-revival>Will Daniel Return For The Degrassi Revival?</h2><p>According to The Hollywood Reporter, it's recently been announced that HBO will invest money and produce <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a Degrassi revival series</a>. This is something Daniel was asked about two years prior in his interview with Conventional Relations. When asked if he would return if asked, Daniel mentioned that he hadn't acted in a while and therefore wasn't sure.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After his time on Degrassi came to an end, Daniel stepped away from the business to pursue his entrepreneurial talents. He attended New York University, where he graduated with Latin honors. This was followed by majoring in political science and minoring in business at The Stern School of Business.</p><ul><li><strong>Daniel Clark briefly interned on The Rachel Maddow Show and was in the research department at ABC News.</strong></li><li><strong>Daniel also worked as a digital news associate for ABC World News with Diane Sawyer.</strong></li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Somehow, he found himself in the real estate business. So, he's a man of many talents. Clearly, it's worked out for him. While he's very secretive about his real estate company, it seems as though it's providing him with a great lifestyle. But that doesn't mean the creative bones in his body have completely vanished.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Cast Of 'Degrassi' Doesn't Think They Handled These Controversial Topics Well</a></span></p><p>"One silver lining of the pandemic is that I’ve started writing again. I have a really great friend of mine and for the last year or so, we’ve been working on a couple of screenplay projects. One’s a series, one’s a movie," Daniel continued. "So I will say a silver lining is that a lot of people, myself included, have had the luxury of being a little creative or investing time in things that you otherwise probably wouldn’t have. There are certain opportunities that wouldn’t be here if the world were still spinning the same way."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-daniel-clark-like-what-happened-to-sean-in-degrassi>Did Daniel Clark Like What Happened To Sean In Degrassi?</h2><p>In his interview with Conventional Relations, Daniel claimed he was happy with how his character evolved on the show. While he started out as a soft-hearted but arrogant bully, Sean eventually became a more responsible person. He even left to join the army.</p><p>Despite being grateful for Degrassi, Daniel admitted that he felt frustrated during his later years on the show...</p><p>"[There] was a time in my career when I probably wanted to do other projects and I think any person who’s in multiple seasons of a show, they think the same thing. They think, 'Is this the only thing I’m ever going to do?' And what a ridiculous thing for a seventeen or eighteen-year-old to think about. Some actors don’t hit their stride until their forties or fifties," Daniel said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Daniel Clark may or may not ever return to acting and find this "stride", it's clear that he's happy living his normal and successful life in Toronto.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Who Did Dan Levy Play On 'Degrassi'?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecOapaKdnGKwra3RpGSdp5mjtG6wxKCpmqujnnq0scCnZJyZnZq%2FsLqMa2dral8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./erana-tyler-wife-of-jamie-tyler-wikipedia-bios-and-the-couples-age-difference-360725-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Erana Tyler, wife of Jamie Tyler?
