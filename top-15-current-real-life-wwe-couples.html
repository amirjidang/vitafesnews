They are able to see their families and the outside world around two times a week, so it comes as no surprise that many male and female stars manage to find some kind of solace with each other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>WWE has become famous over the years for its extramarital scandals, with <a href=#>Seth Rollins </a>and his fiance Leighla Shultz being one of the latest back in 2015. That being said, there are many wrestlers who sign on to the company while they're single and then meet their significant other while&nbsp;training.</p><p>There are some well-known WWE couples, especially since Total Divas has now become a huge hit on the E! Network, but there are also relationships brewing in developmental and superstars who have sadly been split up because of the superstar shake up last week and the WWE draft back in the summer.</p><p>Some couples have managed to last, but some have also split up since these two huge changes have switched up the WWE locker room. Here are 15 couples who have managed to defy the odds and remain together despite the unpredictable life they chose to live as world renowned WWE superstars.</p><h2 id=jimmy-uso-and-naomi>Jimmy Uso And Naomi</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jimmy Uso and Naomi were once part of the cast of Total Divas for the first few seasons of the show that even featured their wedding. They have recently returned to the cast in the most recent season&nbsp;after Naomi revealed that the producers didn't think that there was anything more that could be done with them as a couple.</p><p>Jimmy and Naomi were one of the favourite couples of the WWE Universe for a while and are definitely one that doesn't cause a lot of drama for each other. Jimmy has two children from a previous relationship so when he married Naomi back in 2014 she became the stepmother of them. The children have been featured on Total Divas episodes before, and she has shown that she is a fantastic role model and stepmother to these kids.</p><h2 id=natalya-and-tyson-kidd>Natalya And Tyson Kidd</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Natalya and Tyson Kidd are another couple that was brought to the attention of the WWE Universe as part of Total Divas. The couple has always been seen as one that is perfect for each other since Natalya explained that Tyson was her first boyfriend, they grew up together, learned to wrestle together, and have been inseparable their entire life.</p><p>Their relationship has had its ups and downs as part of Total Divas, but ever since Tyson was injured on WWE TV by Samoa Joe a few years ago, he has been taken off Total Divas as well. The WWE Universe is unaware now as to whether or not Tyson is returning, especially since he is still under contract with WWE right now.</p><h2 id=daniel-bryan-and-brie-bella>Daniel Bryan And Brie Bella</h2><p><a href=#>Daniel Bryan</a> is a former WWE World Heavyweight Champion, while his wife Brie Bella is a former Divas Champion and both stars are faces of Total Divas and Total Bellas. Even though Brie Bella is technically retired, she is still under contract with WWE and working as an ambassador while she's pregnant awaiting the arrival of her first child.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brie and Daniel Bryan have been dating since Brie returned to WWE back in 2012 and decided to marry merely days after Daniel Bryan won the WWE World Championship back at WrestleMania 30. Daniel is currently the General Manager of SmackDown Live since he was forced to retire from in-ring action in WWE back in February 2016.</p><h2 id=the-miz-and-maryse>The Miz And Maryse</h2><p><a href=#>The Miz</a> and Maryse have been dating ever since they were forced to work together on WWE TV back in 2008. Maryse left the company not long after to pursue other avenues of employment, but she continued to date The Miz and the couple later married.</p><p>Miz continued to work for WWE and welcomed his wife back to the company back in April 2o16 after she helped him win the Intercontinental Championship. They have since been one of the It couples on SmackDown and controlled the brand for more than six months when the decision was made to allow them to switch over to Raw. The couple has also been added to Total Divas this past year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=renee-young-and-dean-ambrose>Renee Young And Dean Ambrose</h2><p>Renee Young and <a href=#>Dean Ambrose</a> have been dating since 2013. However, the couple has received death threats and a lot of negativity from the WWE Universe over the past few years after many female fans were unimpressed with the fact that Renee was dating the former Shield member.</p><p>Renee and Dean made their debut on Total Divas in the last season and have since received much better reactions from the WWE Universe. Renee and Dean shocked many fans last week when they announced that they had secretly married back in October at a wedding that was only attended by close family members. It seems that this was met with mostly positive and supportive messages from WWE fans.</p><h2 id=triple-h-and-stephanie-mcmahon>Triple H And Stephanie McMahon</h2><p>The official WWE power couple has been at the helm of the company now for many years. They have three children together and still manage to juggle busy careers as both on-screen&nbsp;and backstage talent. <a href=#>Triple H</a> is the COO of the company while&nbsp;<a href=#>Stephanie McMahon </a>is a major shareholder in her father's company.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They have also been part of some of the biggest storylines on WWE TV as The Authority and married for more than a decade and a half. Stephanie and Triple H have superhuman capabilities and still somehow manage to have normal lives. They are a couple that many of the WWE Universe look up to and use as inspirations, something that their three daughters will also be thinking about.</p><h2 id=john-cena-and-nikki-bella>John Cena And Nikki Bella</h2><p>The ultimate WWE power couple, <a href=#>John Cena</a> and Nikki Bella have been dating now since 2013, just months after Cena's divorce was finalized from his first wife. Nikki has dated <a href=#>Dolph Ziggler </a>before and finally thinks she has found her soulmate in John Cena.</p><p>The former 16-time World Champion and his new fiance have been one of the driving forces in Total Divas and Total Bellas over the past few years, with many of the WWE Universe wondering why John Cena hadn't asked Nikki Bella to marry him yet. Cena shocked the world at WrestleMania 33 a few weeks ago when he finally proposed to Nikki after four years of dating and many years of her complaining that she wanted to get married and have children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=alexa-bliss-and-buddy-murphy>Alexa Bliss And Buddy Murphy</h2><p>Alexa Bliss and Buddy Murphy met when they were down in NXT as part of BAMF, alongside Wesley Blake. Since the trio broke up and Alexa headed to SmackDown as part of the WWE Draft, WWE hasn't done a lot with the former Tag Team Champions. Murphy is stuck down on NXT as he waits to be repackaged, while Alexa has already become a two-time SmackDown Women's Champion and has recently switched to Raw.</p><p>Alexa is moving her way up in the world in WWE and recently Buddy decided to make their relationship a little more official when he proposed to Alexa and she accepted. Alexa may be fast becoming one of the best female wrestlers in WWE but she definitely doesn't forget where she comes from.</p><h2 id=carmella-and-big-cass>Carmella And Big Cass</h2><p>Another WWE couple that was created while they were working together down in NXT, Carmella and Big Cass were once part of a stable along with Enzo Amore, and much like Alexa and Buddy, Carmella and Cass were split when WWE decided to promote Enzo and Cass to the main roster following WrestleMania last year and left Carmella behind.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Carmella has since made a name for herself in NXT and was promoted to the SmackDown roster as part of the WWE Draft last year. The couple hasn't appeared together on WWE TV since and Carmella has instead been aligned with James Ellsworth, but they still share pictures of their romantic outings together on Instagram and attended the Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony together a few weeks ago.</p><h2 id=liv-morgan-and-enzo-amore>Liv Morgan And Enzo Amore</h2><p>One of the newest additions to the list, Enzo Amore and Liv Morgan have only recently shared the fact that they are dating. Liv is currently trying to make a name for herself on the NXT roster as part of the Women's Division, but right now it seems that she is being easily overshadowed.</p><p>It is thought that the couple got closer while they were in NXT together and Enzo actually got Liv her tryout with WWE. Even though he's on the Raw roster along with Big Cass, the couple is still able to travel together and see each other whenever they are on the road at the same time. The couple has shared photos on Instagram together, but are not officially revealed to be a couple as of right now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dana-brooke-and-dolph-ziggler>Dana Brooke And Dolph Ziggler</h2><p>Dana Brooke is another superstar who has come through WWE's developmental set up with her strength and look being two of the biggest things that WWE first saw in her. Dana was moved to Raw quite early in her career and for a while, she was on the same roster as her boyfriend Dolph Ziggler.</p><p>The couple haven't been able to work together despite being on the same brand for a while, but Dolph was drafted over to SmackDown as part of the draft last summer, while&nbsp;Dana followed Charlotte over to Raw. The couple has had a few rumours about them stating that they have split, but as of right now there has been no actual confirmation that they are no longer together.</p><h2 id=sasha-banks-and-sarath-ton>Sasha Banks and Sarath Ton</h2><p>Sasha Banks is one of the most popular WWE females in the company at the moment and that is mostly because of her incredible rise through the company. Sasha did break many hearts last summer though, just days after she won her first main roster Women's Championship, when she married Sarath Ton, a costume designer backstage in WWE.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sarath has been making Sasha's clothes for her since she was on the Independent Circuit and the couple have even wrestled each other many times. Sasha recently took part in an interview where she stated that she hid her marriage for a few months from the WWE Universe because she didn't want to attract the same kind of negativity that Renee Young and Dean Ambrose received in their early years together.</p><h2 id=paige-and-alberto-del-rio>Paige And Alberto Del Rio</h2><p>Even though Paige hasn't appeared on WWE TV for almost a year, she is still a WWE superstar and is contracted to the company for the next few years. Paige and Del Rio announced that they were dating early last year, merely months after Charlotte was said to have been dating <a href=#>Alberto Del Rio</a>.</p><p>The couple moved quickly and were engaged in October last year, just after Del Rio was released from his WWE contract. The couple then shocked fans further when they quickly married back in March after Paige was the victim of an online hacking scandal. The couple has recently revealed that they have bought a model home together on their Instagram accounts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lana-and-rusev>Lana And Rusev</h2><p>Lana and Rusev have been appearing on WWE TV together for the past three years. The couple has had their ups and downs and have even recently been given a place on Total Divas. Lana and Rusev were in hot water with WWE a few months ago when they leaked news of their engagement to TMZ while they were in the middle of a storyline, but it seems the company has moved on from this.</p><p>Rusev and Lana then went on to have two weddings for each of&nbsp;their families before returning to WWE as a couple once more. Rusev recently suffered a shoulder injury that required surgery and has been off WWE TV since, while it was revealed that Lana will be appearing on her own as part of the SmackDown Women's Division moving forward.</p><h2 id=bayley-and-aaron-solow>Bayley And Aaron Solow</h2><p>Bayley is the current Raw Women's Champion and is a former NXT Women's Champion. She has been proving herself for the past few years when it comes to her ability, but many of the WWE Universe thought that Bayley was dating Finn Balor for a while.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It seems that Bayley has been in a relationship with Independent wrestling star Aaron Solow for the past few years since they met when Bayley was also on the Independent roster. Aaron has worked for WWE many times before and was even named as an alternative in the Cruiserweight Classic last year. Sadly, he hasn't been offered a full-time contract yet. The couple announced their engagement late last year after Bayley was called up to the Raw roster.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKifp8G0ecSnq56qpJa2r7nEp6torJ%2BlenKBjJysq6qVo8FuvsSao2akmZuybsPWnmScp6Wluaa%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./vibes-2012-fantasy-football-sleeper-and-bust-picks-109562.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="VIBEs 2012 Fantasy Football Sleeper and Bust Picks">&larr;
