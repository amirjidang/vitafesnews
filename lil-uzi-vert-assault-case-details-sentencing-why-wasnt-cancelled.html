Lil Uzi Vert's incident occurred around the same time as the Tory Lanez and Megan Thee Stallion's shooting; only hip-hop music fans felt the two crimes were not treated equally in the media.</p><p>Despite multiple accounts and eyewitnesses confirming Lil Uzi Vert's violent behavior, the Philadelphia-born rapper has managed to keep his career thriving, even after TMZ reported the assault. Lil Uzi Vert was aligned with Roc Nation, which is why people felt their career continued when many other rappers would likely have been canceled.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Other music fans and social media users took to their accounts to lament that no artists have had their careers taken away from them due to domestic abuse. However, it is noteworthy that this wasn't Lil Uzi Vert's first run-in with the law; the rapper had been arrested in 2016 for dangerous driving on a dirt bike. In 2020, the star was arrested for having a paint gun fight in Philadelphia.</p><p>Lil Uzi, who uses they/them pronouns, has also made headlines with their unique dress sense and unusual body modifications, as well as causing controversy with their lyrics and performance.</p><h2 id=lil-uzi-vert-39-s-assault-case-details-and-sentencing>Lil Uzi Vert's Assault Case Details And Sentencing</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/uzi-vert-bet-awards.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In 2022, Lil Uzi Vert plead no contest to a 2021 assault case</a>. The 28-year-old allegedly attacked his ex-girlfriend and threatened her with a firearm.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The rapper managed to avoid jail time and was sentenced to three years of probation, one year in mental health and substance abuse treatment, 52 weeks in domestic violence counseling, restitution, and ten years under a criminal protective order.</p><p>Uzi’s ex-girlfriend, Brittany Byrd, filed a police report alleging that the "Bad and Boujee" rapper struck her and threatened her with a gun. Byrd and a friend, JHN, were at Dialog Café in West Hollywood for a business meeting when Lil Uzi Vert confronted them.</p><p>The rapper reportedly jumped out of his Escalade and then threw a punch. The eyewitness said Uzi Vert's fist missed the friend, but a gun fell to the ground. Brittany alleged that Uzi put a gun against her stomach and attacked her.</p><p>A week after the incident, Brittany <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Byrd broke her silence about the incident</a>. "Don’t y’all say protect black women right? I’m a black woman," she wrote on social media.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brittany's manager told the press that Lil Uzi Vert was possibly angered by rumors that Brittany Byrd and JHN were dating. She later confirmed these rumors were untrue, and the pair strictly had a working relationship. Lil Uzi Vert has not responded publicly to the allegations or his sentencing.</p><h2 id=lil-uzi-vert-39-s-controversial-on-stage-behavior>Lil Uzi Vert's Controversial On Stage Behavior</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lil-uzi-vert-on-stage.jpg><p>During 2021's Day N Vegan, fans were upset when Lil Uzi Vert was 30 minutes late for his set. The rapper’s mic was seemingly cut after a four-track run, angering the audience.</p><p>Lil Uzi Vert addressed Day N Vegas crowd as attendees yelled that people were fainting. “I don’t take no breaks. If it’s gettin’ bad, leave. If you ain’t gonna leave, stay”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When the crowd retaliated, Lil Uzi Vert remained adamant about not taking breaks. “Don’t stop my rage." Uzi’s set was followed by the festival asking fans to take “a few steps back” for attendees in the front. This came weeks after the Astroworld Festival tragedy in Houston, where 10 attendees died and 300 were injured.</p><h2 id=is-lil-uzi-vert-a-satanist>Is Lil Uzi Vert A Satanist?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lil-uzi-vert-demon-high.jpg><p>Lil Uzi Vert has been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">accused of being a Satanist by his peers.</a> This controversy came last summer when they performed at Rolling Loud Los Angeles and previewed one of their songs. The track received a backlash as some people claimed the lyric “make a City Girl believe in Satan," was inappropriate, especially when paired with their religious-themed backdrop.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The music star was originally labeled a Satanist by battle rapper Daylyt, who claimed the star, real name Symere Woods, worshiped the devil. It has also been noted that his stage name, Lil Uzi Vert, phonetically sounds similar to Lucifer.</p><p>Lil Uzi Vert claimed they were just metaphorically speaking with the lyric. "Not actually Satan, but just basically, I make a girl do whatever I say so," they told TMZ. They have also come under fire for using transphobic language in their music.</p><p>“I just say whatever I want in my songs. It’s just like my freedom of speech,” Lil Uzi clarified. “I come from a real religious household, but I like me finding [and] living my life and being, like, I guess [as] ‘an adult,’ I say anything I want to say. Even if I offend people, I don’t mean to offend people, but if they don’t like it, they have the option to turn it off.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=does-lil-uzi-vert-plan-to-retire>Does Lil Uzi Vert Plan To Retire?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lil-uzi.jpg><p>On October 23, 2023, Lil Uzi Vert announced his plans to retire from rapping. During the Pink Tape tour stop in Chicago, Illinois, the rapper announced, "And Luv Is Rage 3 will be my last album.” 'The Money Longer' rapper claimed they wanted to leave the industry to live a normal life.</p><p>Following the announcement, numerous fans pointed out that the “XO Tour Llif3” rapper had made similar declarations in the past without seriously following through. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">They had previously made this statement on stage in July</a>. Others took to social media to confirm the rapper had expressed numerous statements about seeking a life outside of music.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2019, when they were working on their second album they expressed their desire to leave the industry. "I wanna take the time out to say I thank each and every one of my supports, but I’m done with music. I deleted everything. I wanna be normal... I wanna wake up in 2013.”</p><p>Lil Uzi Vert has yet to follow up on their claims from the Chicago show, but it could be connected to his recent court plea.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijoqRdqseqedWeqa1lkajAosHLrWScmaOaeqWx05qgpatdqLKvwMSnmqKml2LEqcWMsJispqRisKK6wp6jpZ2UZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./1389624-wwe-announces-wrestlemania-40-tickets-will-go-on-sale-august-18.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="WWE Announces WrestleMania 40 Tickets Will Go On Sale August 18">&larr;
