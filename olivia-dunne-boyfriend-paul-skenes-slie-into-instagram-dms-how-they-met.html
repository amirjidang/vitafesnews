The 20-year-old is adored everywhere that she goes, and her future looks incredibly bright. While everyone wants to hear about <a href=#>Olivia Dunne's amazing salary</a> since she is so young, her dating life has become a huge topic of interest as well. Most of the time, people spread rumors about her potential boyfriends, and there is no truth to these stories. But the star is in a new relationship that seems to be going great.</p><p>Olivia Dunne and baseball star Paul Skenes recently began dating, and fans would love to know how they met each other. Here's whether Paul Skenes messaged Olivia Dunne on social media and what the start of their relationship was actually like.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-did-olivia-dunne-and-paul-skenes-meet>How Did Olivia Dunne And Paul Skenes Meet?</h2><p>After fans thought that <a href=#>Livvy Dunne and Morgan Wallen were together</a> at some point in 2023, she has someone else in her life now: Paul Skenes. The 21-year-old athlete plays for the Pittsburgh Pirates and has seen an overwhelming amount of success in the past few years. He and Dunne seem perfectly matched because they are young, athletic, and famous.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/paul-skenes.jpg><p>According to Brobible.com, people began wondering if <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Olivia Dunne and Paul Skenes were dating</a> in mid-August 2023. This is because Dunne went to his baseball game in Bradenton, Florida.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Does Olivia Dunne Get Paid?

But that isn't how she and Paul Skenes began their relationship. In fact, they met the same way that many couples do: because they had some pals in common. A lot of people would agree that this is the best way to meet someone. While of course online dating will always be a popular and easy way to meet new people, it can be nice to go on a date with someone who has been vetted by a close friend. That takes a bit of the stress and overwhelm out of the equation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/did-olivia-dunne-s-rumored-boyfriend-paul-skenes-slide-into-her-dms_-here-s-how-they-really-met.jpg><p>In an interview with The Pittsburg Post-Gazette in August 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul Skenes shared how he and Olivia Dunne met</a>. He explained that they were introduced because he is friends with an LSU student who is in a relationship with Elena Marenas.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As Dunne's many fans know, Marenas and Dunne live together, and Marenas is frequently featured on Dunne's TikTok.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/why-does-olivia-dunne-make-so-much-money_-the-truth-about-tiktok-fame-and-sponsored-instagram-posts-changed-her-net-worth-forever.jpg><p>Skenes told The Pittsburg Post-Gazette that when he and Dunne first chatted, it was “Just a small-world type of thing." He sounds happy that their paths ended up crossing.</p><h2 id=what-did-olivia-dunne-and-paul-skenes-say-about-their-relationship>What Did Olivia Dunne And Paul Skenes Say About Their Relationship?</h2><p>Olivia Dunne doesn't appear to have commented on her romance with Paul Skenes. However, she did seem to suggest that she has a tough time dating earlier in 2023.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/th-image-template-4.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Marca.com, when a fan told her "there is no way someone is leaving Livvy Dunne on delivered," she said, "you'd be surprised." It was definitely shocking to hear the huge star say that sometimes people don't answer her text messages.</p><p>While Olivia Dunne hasn't talked much about her new boyfriend, Paul Skenes has opened up much more.</p><p>It's great to know that Dunne and Skenes met each other in a more natural way that had nothing to do with social media. It sounds like the relationship is going well, at least from what Skenes has said.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>8 Things You Might Not Know About Gymnast-Turned-TikTok Star Olivia Dunne</a></span></p><p>In his interview with The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Skenes talked about what it's like to be a public figure who is dating someone else who is always in the spotlight. He explained that it can be hard for the two of them to head out into the world without people talking to them. He sounded very respectful of Dunne and he definitely cares about her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Skenes said, “It’s nice, for sure. It can be a pain in the butt sometimes, to be honest, in terms of actually going somewhere. If one of us went out in Baton Rouge [La.] by ourselves, there’s probably gonna be someone there asking for something — picture, autograph, whatever."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/olivia-dunne-outside.jpg><p>Skenes continued to The Pittsburg Post-Gazette that Dunne understands what his life is like and that is really helpful.</p><p>He said, “It’s nice to be able to have that conversation. She does get it. I do wish she could come to a baseball game and just enjoy it. It does irk me. I don’t have any control over it. She really doesn’t either. I’m sure it’ll get better as I go up levels, but that’s something I want for her.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Miley Cyrus' Strange Vocal Fry Is TikTok’s Viral Obsession, But Here's What Really Happened To Her Speaking Voice</a></span></p><p>It's fair to say that Skenes and Dunne are equally well-known, and, therefore, they can relate to each other. Even though Dunne seems to love her time at LSU, she isn't a regular college student, and Skenes isn't a regular 21-year-old, either.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/th-image-template-5.jpg><p>Since Skenes shared with The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that Dunne understands his celebrity lifestyle, it seems possible that Dunne would say the same thing about him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview with Elle Magazine in July 2023, Dunne explained that she knows that people pay attention to her physical appearance. She shared that it can be difficult to hear what people say about her and that she wishes everyone would think about her age. While Dunne hasn't talked about her new romance, it seems likely that she and Skenes talk about these type of topics.</p><p>Dunne said, “It’s not a girl’s responsibility how a man looks at her or how he acts, especially when you’re doing your sport and that’s your uniform. I can’t help the way I look, and I’m going to post what I feel comfortable with. It’s hard to handle at times, definitely, because I am just a 20-year-old student. I think people do forget that.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGimpaGmnq5usNSnpZ5lkqTGp77InqWdZaCWwq150qScp52jYsCttcRmoKesn2K2r7%2FTmp6rmZ1isa6%2FjKGmsGWknbK6ecyeq2g%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-the-cast-of-succession-spends-their-enormous-salary.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Does The Cast Of Succession Live Nearly As Luxuriously As Their Lovably Unlikable Characters?">&larr;
