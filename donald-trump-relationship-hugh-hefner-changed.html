We'll also reveal what Trump was like during his appearances at the Playboy Mansion over the years. Trump made several appearances, and former Playmate Holly Madison commented on what he was really like behind the scenes.</p><p>Let's take a closer look.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:07</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/taylor-swift-shocked-fans-after-revealing-intense-anxiety-around-her-new-music-leaking-deposit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Hugh Hefner And Playboy Had Major Plans For Taylor Swift To Completely Revolutionize The Company ">Hugh Hefner And Playboy Had Major Plans For Taylor Swift To Completely Revolutionize The Company</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>High Hefner and Playboy made Taylor Swift a tempting offer back in 2016, completely changing the direction of its magazine.</p><h2 id=hugh-hefner-39-s-son-cooper-said-his-father-39-s-relationship-with-trump-suddenly-changed-over-different-philosophies>Hugh Hefner's Son Cooper Said His Father's Relationship With Trump Suddenly Changed Over Different Philosophies</h2><p>There was a lot of confusion over Hefner's changing relationship with Donald Trump. The two had a lengthy history together, which seemed to be positive, especially given that Donald was the first male on the cover of Playboy in 1990. Even when Trump was running for President, Hugh Hefner showed lots of optimism.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hefner said at the time, "Voters nominated Donald Trump, a thrice-married New York entrepreneur who once owned the Miss USA pageant, over Cruz, the son of a pastor," Hefner wrote. "It's a sign of the massive changes in the 'family values party' and proof of…a sexual revolution in the Republican Party."</p><p>However, it seems like things changed after Hefner's son, Cooper, stated that his dad was embarrassed over Trump's magazine cover.</p><p>"We don't respect the guy. There's a personal embarrassment because Trump is somebody who has been on our cover."</p><p>There wasn't an exact reason as to why, but rumors suggest Trump hiring Mike Pence as his Vice-President might've had something to do with it. Hefner was a supporter of LGBT rights, while Pence opposed gay marriage. Trump also put a ban on transgender joining the military, which also received a lot of hate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/donald-trump.jpg> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/your-paragraph-text-2024-04-15t121509-000.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Ivana Trump Had Opposite Reactions To Melania And Marla Maples' Being Mentioned In An Interview ">Ivana Trump Had Opposite Reactions To Melania And Marla Maples' Being Mentioned In An Interview</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Ivana Trump's mood changed when Marla Maples' name was brought up during an interview.</p><p>Trump hasn't said anything in return to Cooper's comments - Trump also chose to keep quiet following Hefner's passing.</p><h2 id=donald-trump-had-a-lengthy-history-with-playboy-that-was-amicable-for-years>Donald Trump Had A Lengthy History With Playboy That Was Amicable For Years</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Trump's history with Playboy</a> started back in March of 1990 when he appeared on the cover.

"I was a judge at his Miss USA pageant when he used to own it, so it's definitely kind of surreal and weird."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hugh-hefner-smiling.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Madison continued on, stating that Donald always treated her with respect during their random encounters at the mansion.</p><p>"I met Donald Trump a few times, but I don't know him well or anything. He was always polite and really nice."</p><p>As for Madison's relationship with Hefner, it was completely broken. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Madison defended the fact that she didn't mourn his death</a>.</p><p>“When he passed away, everybody expected me to have some big reaction or post about it on social media, and it just felt weird. I didn't have any emotional attachment to him anymore in any way."</p><p>It certainly was a troubling time for Madison alongside Hefner.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibqKaRobFuwNGupKllopq5osDIqKWsoJmleqnBxqFkoZ2Wo7KzecKhmKeflZl8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./selena-gomez-strappy-flats-amazon-fashion.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Grab a Pair of Strappy Flats Like Selena Gomezs for Under $50">&larr;
