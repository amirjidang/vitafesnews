Since he first swooned onto the scene back in 1962, Bond has been a hit with fans, who just can't seem to get enough of this super-sauve, martini-swilling spy character.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Today the franchise is estimated to be worth around $20 million which makes James Bond one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.</p><p>Over the years the role of the world's most famous spy has been played by seven actors; Sean Connery, David Niven, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan, and Daniel Craig. But for every actor who got to play Bond, there were a few who auditioned for the part and didn't get it. There have even been actors who've turned the role down, many times because they were afraid of being typecast as a spy.</p><p>Let's check out the actors who almost played Bond!</p><h2 id=gerard-butler-felt-playing-007-would-typecast-him><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>Gerard Butler Felt Playing 007 Would Typecast Him</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gerard Butler</a> felt that accepting the Bond role might put an end to the variety of work he gets. "I enjoy doing an array of films. If I was to play Bond, that would quickly stop. How likely would I be accepted doing those roles after having played Bond?" he explained.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=henry-cavill-was-deemed-too-young-to-play-bond><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>Henry Cavill Was Deemed Too Young To Play Bond</span></h2><p>When a new James Bond was being chosen for Casino Royale, Henry Cavill was one of the top actors in the running for the role. But Cavill was just 22 at the time and was deemed too young for the part so the filmmakers decided to go with the then-37-year-old Daniel Craig instead.</p><h2 id=christian-bale-thought-idris-elba-would-make-an-ideal-bond-and-the-internet-agreed><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Christian Bale Thought&nbsp;Idris Elba Would Make An Ideal Bond And The Internet Agreed</span></h2><p>While Christian Bale might have the&nbsp;look to pull off James Bond, he just wasn't interested but he did have an opinion about who should take over as 007. His pick: Idris Elba. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">internet agreed with him</a>, and although he's never been formally approached for the role, fans are still hopeful!</p><h2 id=michael-caine-didn-t-want-to-make-another-spy-movie><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Michael Caine Didn't Want To Make Another Spy Movie</span></h2><p>Today everyone knows Michael Caine as Alfred in the Christopher Nolan Batman films but there was a time when (a much younger) Caine was being considered for the role of Bond. Back then he turned it down because he had done a string of spy movies and didn't want to be typecast.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sean-bean-almost-took-over-the-role-from-timothy-dalton><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Sean Bean Almost Took Over The Role From Timothy Dalton</span></h2><p>Back in the day, Game of Thrones star Sean Bean came so close to playing Bond he could almost smell the martinis, but it wasn't meant to be. Bean was a favorite contender to take over the role from Timothy Dalton but he ended up as a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bond villain</a> instead.</p><h2 id=richard-burton-could-have-been-the-first-james-bond-but-he-thought-it-was-just-another-movie><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Richard Burton Could Have Been The First James Bond But He Thought It Was Just Another Movie</span></h2><p>Richard Burton was a Shakespearean actor in the 1950s, well known for his performance in Hamlet and for being married to Elizabeth Taylor. He was offered the role of James Bond in Dr. No but after discussing it with his family he passed, thinking it would be "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">just another movie</a>".</p><h2 id=alex-o-loughlin-lost-the-role-to-daniel-craig><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Alex O'Loughlin Lost The Role To Daniel Craig</span></h2><p>Before he landed the role of Steve McGarrett on Hawaii Five-0, Alex O'Loughlin did screen tests for the part of James Bond in Casino Royale. He was one of the top candidates for the role following Pierce Brosnan's departure from the franchise, but in the end, the part went to Daniel Craig.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Actors Who Were Notoriously Demanding On Set</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tom-selleck-wasn-t-interested-in-playing-a-guy-like-james-bond><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Tom Selleck Wasn't Interested In Playing A Guy Like James Bond</span></h2><p>Despite having almost all the right physical characteristics to play Bond (as well as that sauve leading-man presence) Magnum&nbsp;<i>P.I.</i>'s Tom Selleck wasn't the least bit interested in the role of James Bond. When asked why not <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he said</a>, “I don’t want to play a guy like that.” Okay, then.</p><h2 id=christian-bale-passed-on-bond-because-he-d-had-enough-of-playing-a-hero><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Christian Bale Passed On Bond Because He'd Had Enough Of Playing A Hero</span></h2><p>Batman as Bond? It could have happened. Christian Bale was approached for the role of 007 but he turned it down. After playing Bruce Wayne/Batman for more than a decade, Bale had no interest in taking on another hero-type role. "I'm good. My days of wearing capes are over," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he said</a>.</p><h2 id=dougray-scott-felt-he-was-too-old-to-be-007><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Dougray Scott Felt He Was Too Old To Be 007</span></h2><p>There was a time when Dougray Scott was considered to be the forerunner to take over the Bond role from Pierce Brosnan. He was in talks to play 007 in Die Another Day but Brosnan then agreed to do one last film, which put an end to Scott's dreams of playing the world's most famous spy.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Great Actors You Won’t Believe Haven’t Won An Oscar</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=clint-eastwood-turned-down-the-role-because-he-believed-james-bond-should-be-british><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Clint Eastwood Turned Down The Role Because He Believed James Bond Should Be British</span></h2><p>Clint Eastwood turned down the Bond role because he did not want the superspy portrayed as American. “I thought James Bond should be British. I am of British descent but by that same token, I thought that it should be more of the culture there and also, it was not my thing," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he said</a>.</p><h2 id=james-purefoy-lost-the-bond-role-because-he-wanted-to-make-too-many-changes-to-the-franchise><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>James Purefoy Lost The Bond Role Because He Wanted To Make Too Many Changes To The Franchise</span></h2><p>If there's one man who looks good in a tux it's James Purejoy, so it's not surprising that he's been in the running for 007. He screen-tested for GoldenEye back in the '90s and although he didn't get the part, it was rumored that he might eventually replace Pierce Brosnan. Sadly, it just never happened.</p><h2 id=sam-neill-lost-out-to-timothy-dalton-because-he-wasn-t-as-good-looking><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Sam Neill Lost Out To Timothy Dalton Because He Wasn't As Good Looking</span></h2><p>Sam Neill <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wasn't really interested in playing James Bond</a> but back in the '80s, his agent pushed him to audition for the part anyway. The studio was looking for a replacement for Roger Moore and although they were impressed with Neill they decided to go with the dashing (although maybe not as talented) Timothy Dalton.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=james-brolin-was-cast-as-bond-but-was-dumped-when-roger-moore-agreed-to-return><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>James Brolin Was Cast As Bond But Was Dumped When Roger Moore Agreed To Return</span></h2><p>When Roger Moore announced that he wanted to leave the franchise, James Brolin (Josh Brolin's dad) auditioned for the role and was tentatively hired as the new James Bond for Octopussy. But then Moore decided he wanted to return, which meant there was no room for Brolin. That's a tough one!</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Career-Defining Roles These Actors Can Never Top</a></span></p><h2 id=sir-michael-gambon-wasn-t-fit-enough-to-be-007><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Sir Michael Gambon Wasn't Fit Enough To Be 007</span></h2><p>When Sean Connery announced his departure from the Bond franchise Michael Gambon was one of the actors considered as his replacement. But Gambon didn't feel that he had the physical requirements to take on the role and told Albert R. Broccoli that he wasn't fit enough to do it. Albus Dumbledore as James Bond?

Owen wanted gross profit points on the films and the studio just wasn't having it, so they moved on Craig instead.
