Although <a href=#>Jim Parsons</a> came back to narrate part of his character’s life for the prequel, it’s <a href=#>Iain Armitage</a> who gives life to the young version of Sheldon Cooper. Now, with six seasons and over 100 episodes, Young Sheldon is one of the most popular coming-of-age sitcoms nowadays.
