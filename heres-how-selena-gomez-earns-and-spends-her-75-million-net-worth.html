Since then, Selena Gomez has been a staple in the entertainment industry — and according to Celebrity Net Worth, she currently has an estimated net worth of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$75 million</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a class=bc-title-link title="Here’s How Hailey Bieber Earns And Spends Her $20 Million Net Worth" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s How Hailey Bieber Earns And Spends Her $20 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Today, we're taking a look at just how Selena earns and spends her millions. From splurging on her health to creating an empire with Rare Beauty — keep on scrolling to find out more about the former Disney Channel star's finances!</p><h2 id=earns-her-music-releases><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Earns: Her Music Releases</span></h2><p>We're kicking the list off with the most obvious way that Selena Gomez makes her millions — through her successful music releases. Over the course of her career, Selena released six successful albums: Kiss & Tell (2009), A Year Without Rain (2010), When the Sun Goes Down (2011), Stars Dance (2013), Revival (2015), Rare (2020) and this year she released her Spanish-language EP, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelación</a>. Besides this, the former Disney Channel star also headlined five successful tours!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=spends-security><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Spends: Security</span></h2><p>It's definitely not too surprising that the rich and famous tend to spend a lot of money on security — and Selena Gomez is certainly no different. In 2014, after an i<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ntruder was caught twice</a>&nbsp;tresspassing onto her property, the former Disney Channel star decided to invest in even more security. It's safe to say that nowadays Selena values her safety a lot — and she certainly spends plenty of money on it!</p><h2 id=earns-acting-in-movies-and-shows><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Earns:&nbsp;Acting In Movies And Shows</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As fans know, Selena Gomez actually kicked off her career as an actress on the Disney Channel hit Wizards of Waverly Place back in 2007.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a class=bc-title-link title="Here’s How Katy Perry And Orlando Bloom Earn And Spend Their Joint $370 Million Net Worth" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s How Katy Perry And Orlando Bloom Earn And Spend Their Joint $370 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p>While Selena has since mostly focused on her music career, the star has also done some acting — and she is best known for starring in movies like The Fundamentals of Caring, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Princess Protection Program</a>, and Monte Carlo, as well as appearing in shows such as Sonny with a Chance, The Suite Life of Zack & Cody, and Hannah Montana. Besides this, Selena was also an Executive Producer of the Netflix show 13 Reasons Why.</p><h2 id=spends-her-health><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Spends: Her Health</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the years Selena Gomez has certainly opened up quite a lot about her health to fans — and those who have been keeping up with the star know that she has been diagnosed with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">lupus</a> as well as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bipolar disorder</a>. It's safe to say that one thing that Selena doesn't regret spending my spending money on is her wellbeing — and she has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">always been vocal</a> about just import how important it is to take care of one's mental and physical health.</p><h2 id=earns-her-makeup-line-rare-beauty><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Earns: Her Makeup Line Rare Beauty</span></h2><p>Another big source of income for the former Disney Channel star is certainly her makeup line Rare Beauty. The brand was launched in September 2020 amidst the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, and so far it has been a major success for the star. The line is cruelty-free and vegan and there is no doubt that Selena will release plenty more products within it in the future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=spends-travelling><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Spends: Travelling</span></h2><p>Just like most others celebs, Selena Gomez also loves splurging on traveling and those who follow the star on social media have certainly seen her go on a bunch of luxurious vacations over the years. Needless to say that wherever Selena goes she stays in very expensive accommodation and she most likely flies there in a private jet!</p><h2 id=earns-her-cooking-show-selena-chef><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Earns: Her Cooking Show 'Selena + Chef'</span></h2><p>In April 2020 the cooking show Selena + Chef premiered on HBO Max and it immediately became a huge success.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a class=bc-title-link title="Here’s How Bella Thorne Earns And Spends Her $12 Million Net Worth" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s How Bella Thorne Earns And Spends Her $12 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Selena Gomez is the host of the show and in each episode, she is tackling a new dish with the help of a guest star professional chef. So far, the show has two seasons released — and this spring it was renewed for a third one.</p><h2 id=spends-investments><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Spends: Investments</span></h2><p>While Selena is a musician and an actress — she's also a very talented businesswoman who loves investing her money in great projects. Last year the star invested in the popular New York City-based ice cream brand Serendipity — and she did that during the time that the song "Ice Cream" which featured her and the Korean pop group Blackpink was hitting the charts. Talk about smart timing!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=earns-brand-deals><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Earns: Brand Deals</span></h2><p>A big part of Selena's income also comes from brand deals — and in 2017 she was the face of activewear company Puma which paid her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$30 million</a>. A year prior to that, the former Disney Channel star also had a $10 million endorsement deal with the brand Coach. Besides that, it is estimated that one Instagram post from Selena Gomez is worth about $3.5 million so it's no surprise that brands always want to collaborate with the star!</p><h2 id=spends-properties><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Spends: Properties</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>I'm finally wrapping the list up is the fact that Selena Gomez <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">loves spending her money on properties</a>. In 2014 the star spent $3.69 million to buy a mansion in a Calabasas. A year later the star bought a large home in Fort Worth, Texas which she sold last year for $2.4 million. In 2017 the musician bought a home in Studio City, California for $2.2 million and last spring the star paid $4.9 million for a property in Encino, California.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="How Paris Hilton Earns & Spends Her $300 Million Net Worth" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Paris Hilton Earns & Spends Her $300 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHqpu9Zmqp6klaOubrPOppyzZZWWv6%2B%2FjJqlnWWjpbKvsNJmn56qXWyCbrnIpaOip55iu6bAjLCmq6yYZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./hollywood-icon-paul-newman-volvo-up-for-sale.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hollywood icon Paul Newman's amazing Volvo up for sale - it could be yours for around 22,000">&larr;
