Twenty-four-year-old Atiana is the daughter of Moakler and boxer Oscar De La Hoya.</p><p>The former couple started dating in 1997, got engaged in 1998, and welcomed Atiana in March 1999. The couple never married because Moakler "discovered Oscar was cheating on her." The former Miss USA winner later claimed in a lawsuit that Oscar was an abusive alcoholic. They settled the case out of court in 2001.</p><p>Travis Barker came into Atiana De La Hoya's life in 2004, when he married Moakler. The couple filed for divorce in 2006 but briefly reconciled before finalizing their divorce in 2008. The on/off pair continued to live together until 2014 to raise Atiana, along with their <a href=#>two kids, Alabama and Landon.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like her stepparents, Atiana De La Hoya is a reality TV star in her own right.
