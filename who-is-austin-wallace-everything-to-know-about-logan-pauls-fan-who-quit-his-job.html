Here’s everything you should know about him.</strong></p><p>Austin Wallace, a native of Ohio, claims that he abandoned his job to work in the Logan Paul universe.</p><p>He’s a TikTok celebrity who weeps when Logan Paul joins him at work.</p><p>Austin quit his $100,000-a-year job to work with Logan Paul, an American YouTuber and web-based media personality, but he got fired.</p><p>One of the most well-known YouTubers isn’t looking to add just anyone to his team.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tiktok-austin-wallace-job-details></span>TikTok: Austin Wallace Job Details<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Austin Wallace was one of the renowned TikTok stars and a social media influencer. He earns up to $100,000 from his job.</p><p>TikTok star Austin Wallace, also known as @aj wallace69 on TikTok, made his way behind the scenes and approached ‘The Maverick’ for a job.</p><p>Austin Wallace was rejected down by Logan Paul. The YouTube sensation explained that he works with a small staff and is unable to devote time to mentoring at this time.</p><p>On the other hand, Logan Paul provided Austin Wallace some excellent counsel, telling him to relocate to Los Angeles and begin establishing contacts.</p><p>Moreover, Austin recorded the entire exchange on his TikTok account.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=austin-wallace-age-how-old-is-he></span>Austin Wallace Age: How Old Is He?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Austin Wallace’s age is&nbsp;<strong>22&nbsp;years old</strong>. However, he has not yet disclosed his exact age as he has not revealed his birth details to the public and media.</p><p>Unfortunately, we are unable to locate Austin Wallace’s personal information. His video with Logan, though, catapulted him into the spotlight.</p><p>Talking about his physique, he seems to stand tall with a height of 6 feet 6 inches approximately. However, his exact measurement has not been mentioned over the web.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=austin-wallace-instagram-bio-explored></span>Austin Wallace Instagram Bio Explored<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Austin Wallace is active on Instagram with the username&nbsp;@850_bigdog_.

According to the current situation, we presume he earns a steady income from his YouTube videos.</p><p>Apart from that, we are unable to trace his previous employment history. Austin might get a new employment offer sooner rather than later. Because Jake insisted on using other platforms, he was given a new opportunity.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-did-logan-paul-tell-austin-wallace></span>What Did Logan Paul Tell Austin Wallace?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Logan Paul said that he can’t be a mentor at the moment as he is also all messed up.</p><p>He also stated that he requires the assistance of a mentor. As a result, I asked him to go produce content with Austin’s pals.</p><p>Logan Paul also remarked that quitting a job takes courage, but now you must be active.</p><p>And he is not the one who hires for the job; it is his team.</p><p>He also said that he moved to LA to find friends, exactly like you did with me. When he made the comment, he was serious.</p><p>Furthermore, he has always maintained that if you can communicate with others, you can succeed in Los Angeles.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4yarKysmaN6uK3LpZicnV2aw6a%2B2K2foqaXYsGwecqnprBlkZe8tsCMpaagmZ5ivaLBy6xkn5meYsSpu4yqrKKsXZ22tHnJqJlo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-mamie-till-husband-gene-bradley-mobley-married-in-1957-and-divorced-details-to-know-205878-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Mamie Till Husband Gene Bradley Mobley?
