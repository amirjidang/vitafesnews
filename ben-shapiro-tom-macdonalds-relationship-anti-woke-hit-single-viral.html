This just makes Shapiro, his <a href=#>super private wife Mor</a>, and his <a href=#>controversial sister Abigail</a> more mysterious.</p><p>Ben Shapiro isn't shy about his political beliefs, though, whether he's interviewing others for The Daily Wire or sharing thoughts on social media. That's why it wasn't a huge surprise when he teamed up with Tom MacDonald on <strong>the song "Facts." MacDonald is from Canada</strong> and known for rap <strong><a href=#>music</a></strong> that is critical of society. What was surprising was when <strong><a href=#>Nicki Minaj</a> </strong>congratulated Ben Shapiro on the success of the song, given their history. While people are curious about how this song came to be, they also want to know the status of Ben Shapiro and Tom MacDonald's relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=were-ben-shapiro-and-tom-macdonald-friends-before-they-recorded-quot-facts-quot-together>Were Ben Shapiro And Tom MacDonald Friends Before They Recorded "Facts" Together?</h2><p>While <strong>Ben Shapiro and Tom MacDonald don't appear to be close friends</strong>, they have been in contact ever since they met each other in Los Angeles. According to PR Newswire, the two kept in contact after they shared a photo of the two of them that people were critical of.

He explained that since he has a musical background., rapping felt logical to him. He said, "As a longtime devotee of rap, becoming a rapper was the natural next step in my career trajectory. So, when Tom asked if I wanted to collaborate on a song, I leapt at the chance. This was the moment I spent 20 years of classical violin training preparing for. For those who don't appreciate my artistic stylings, all I can say is that they didn't appreciate Bach properly in his own time, either."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ttweb_everything-we-know-about-ben-shapiro-s-wife-mor-shapiro-and-what-she-does-for-a-living-_bk_a1_v3.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Everything We Know About Ben Shapiro's Wife Mor Shapiro (And What She Does For A Living)</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Ben Shapiro's wife Mor has a surprising career, although she probably doesn't need it given her husband's fame and fortune.</span><p>Tom MacDonald's Albums</p><ul><li>"All Growed Up" (2012)</li><li>"See You Tomorrow" (2015)</li><li>"Deathreats" (2018)</li><li>"Ghostories" (2019)</li><li>"Killing the Neighbors" (2020)</li><li>Gravestones (2020)</li><li>"As Far as the Stars" (2021)</li><li>"Us Against the World" (2021)</li><li>"The Brave" (2022)</li><li>"Renegade" (2022)</li><li>"The Revolution" (2022)</li><li>"The Brave 2" (2023)</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ben-shapiro-from-the-daily-wire-speech.jpg><p>Tom MacDonald was excited to work with Shapiro and explained to PR Newswire:</p><p>I like to do things nobody else can do.

He looked upset as he read the lyrics and he criticized them. When Minaj tweeted a gif and wrote "Roman said leave his a** out of it sir!
