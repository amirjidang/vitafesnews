JC had a versatile voice that could float into falsettos or belt into powerhouse runs, and from an early age, it was clear that he would pursue a career in music.</p><p>As a member of iconic boy band NSYNC, JC was signed to Jive Records. The Y2K pop era, in which the band was big, was a very distinctive time in popular culture: From oversized clothing to choreographed dance moves to futuristic album designs.</p><p>NSYNC was formed in 1997 by businessman Lou Pearlman, and they became one of the most successful and recognizable pop acts of the time. Chris Kirkpatrick, Lance Bass, JC Chasez, Joey Fatone, and Justin Timberlake all had the looks and personalities to enter the teen market and dominate it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But what did their lives look like when they weren't performing?

She is an executive assistant at Broad and Cassel LLP.</p><p>According to LinkedIn, Jennifer HuYoung has a proven track record for keeping the busy schedules of company leaders under control while helping to manage the day-to-day operations of a bustling office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There's no doubt of the strong love between these two. As proof of it, JC Chasez used This I Promise You lyrics to profess his love for Jennifer on social media.</p><h2 id=jc-and-jennifer-huyoung-are-rather-private>JC And Jennifer HuYoung Are Rather Private</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/untitled-design-2024-02-20t093117-734.jpg><p>Although JC Chasez was once one of the most talked about pop stars in the world back when NSYNC was all the hype, the artist chooses to live a rather low-key life nowadays. Not much is known about the details of his relationship with Jennifer and if the two ever plan on tying the knot.</p><p>The rare glimpse into their lives comes from the Instagram photos JC Chasez posts with Jennifer every so often.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nsync-was-releasing-hit-after-hit-back-in-the-day>NSYNC Was Releasing Hit After Hit Back In The Day</h2><p>It wouldn't be until their second studio record, titled No Strings Attached, that NSYNC genuinely defined themselves as a force to be reckoned with. The forward-thinking production and ahead-of-its-time writing led to groundbreaking success.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/nsync-almost-didn-t-record-this-hit-song-bye-bye-bye-1.jpg><p>Ironically, when they were the most successful, they became entrenched in a messy legal battle with their manager and record label. Fighting for their name, NSYNC would have to overcome bad contracts and greedy men trying to take advantage of them.</p><h2 id=finding-the-perfect-band-members>Finding The Perfect Band Members</h2><p>Member Chris Kirkpatrick started the creation of the boy band. Chris was in college working part-time in a doo-wop group at Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida. While working there, he was connected through a mutual friend to a man named Lou Pearlman.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One day, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lou carted a private plane to the group</a> New Kids On The Block. After asking them what they did and observing how much money they made in record sales, he decided to create boy bands. After completing the Backstreet Boys, Lou told Chris to find another boy band to fund them.</p><p>Chris started making some calls and found Justin Timberlake, who had previously worked on The Mickey Mouse Club. Justin agreed and referred his friend and co-star, JC Chasez, to be a part of the group.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/boybands-albums.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Most Famous Boy Bands, Ranked By How Many Albums They Released</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>We're taking a look at some of the biggest boy bands in history and ranking them according to how many albums they have released.</span><p>After all three members linked up, they spotted Joey Fatone dancing at Universal's Pleasure Island and asked him to join the group. Joey accepted and further offered his friend Jason Watkins to be the last member. However, Jason didn't feel like being in a boy band was for him and dropped out. In search of the last singer, Justin's mom called his old vocal coach, and they found their last member, Lance Bass.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nsync-39-s-legal-issues>NSYNC's Legal Issues</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nsync.jpg><p>In November 1999, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NSYNC launched a countersuit against Lou Pearlman for 25 million</a> dollars, citing fraud.</p><p>In court documents, JC Chasez called Pearlman "an unscrupulous, greedy businessman who while hugging us and calling us' family' was picking out pockets, robbing us of our future and even endangering our health."</p><p>Tax forms filed on behalf of NSYNC indicated that members of the group earned only approximately 20,000 dollars each in 1997 and 38,000 dollars in 1998. Despite this, their record label and management were making hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The court battle became a highly publicized event, with NSYNC fans praying for the win outside the courtrooms. On November 24, 1999, Judge Anne C. Conway denied BMG's and Lou's attempt to stop the group from using their name and releasing their second studio album until after the case went to trial.</p><p>Luckily, before the case had to go to trial, on December 23, 1999, it was announced that NSYNC, Transcontinental, and Jive Records could come to a compromise and settle out of court.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsButsJmmqGZo5rHtHnGoqmlnqKesq%2BwjKOcp6aZm7KzeceusKitnpx8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-vaughn-evelyn-levesque-triple-hs-daughter-with-stephanie-mcmahon.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Vaughn Evelyn Levesque, Triple Hs Daughter With Stephanie McMahon?">&larr;
