Disney Channel has brought many talented actors into the limelight, each of them being a star in their own right. Children around the globe grow up watching television shows such as That’s So Raven and Hannah Montana, and the persona Disney forces upon its stars is nothing but joy and innocence.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, actors and actresses who have left have spoken about how starring on Disney Channel is not what it seems. Young stars are turned into role models overnight, which can be a lot of pressure and does not always end well. Many stars do not regret leaving Disney and have actually done better in their careers since their exits. Here are eight stars who do not regret leaving.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Does Dove Cameron’s Career Suggest A Darker Side Of The Disney Channel?</a></span></p><h2 id=dove-cameron-released-song-lsquo-boyfriend-rsquo><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Dove Cameron Released Song ‘Boyfriend’</span></h2><p>Dove Cameron starred in two franchises for Disney Channel. She played both Liv and Maddie in the show Liv and Maddie from 2013 to 2017. Cameron also was the lead in the Disney Channel original movie Descendants and its sequels, which tells the story of various Disney villain’s’ children. Cameron met her ex-boyfriend on set of the movie franchise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cameron began stepping away from Disney after the third Descendants movie was released in 2019 in order to properly pursue music. Though she has returned for small voice acting rolls, Cameron has found great success outside of Disney. She has released a lot of music, most notably ‘Boyfriend’ and ‘LazyBaby.’</p><h2 id=sabrina-carpenter-stars-in-netflix-rsquo-s-alice-in-wonderland><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Sabrina Carpenter Stars In Netflix’s Alice In Wonderland</span></h2><p>Sabrina Carpenter has been busy since her days on Disney Channel’s Girl Meets World, which was a reboot of Boy Meets World. She has starred in many large film productions, including The Hate U Give, Tall Girl, and Work It. <strong><a href=#>Netflix </a></strong>has announced that Carpenter will be leading their cast of the musical Alice, based on Alice In Wonderland. Carpenter also has a remarkable music career with songs such as ‘Skinny Dipping’ and ‘Why.’</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Carpenter got into hot water with another Disney star, Olivia Rodrigo</a>. Fans speculated if Carpenter had stolen Rodrigo’s boyfriend, and frankly the entire ordeal was a complete mess.</p><h2 id=olivia-rodrigo-is-a-music-sensation><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Olivia Rodrigo Is A Music Sensation</span></h2><p>Speaking of Olivia Rodrigo, she herself is taking a step back from Disney. Though she has not yet announced she is completely leaving Disney, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she is not a regular in season three of her show </a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">High School Musical: The Musical: The Series</a>. She starred in the show after leaving Disney Channel’s Bizaardvark, and her career has taken off.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rodrigo was nominated for multiple Grammy’s for her debut album, Sour. ‘Driver’s License’ was a worldwide success, and Rodrigo is currently touring for the album. Fans expect big things from Rodrigo and are hoping she will continue to find success without Disney’s limitations.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Selena Gomez And Miley Cyrus Were Friends During Their Disney Days, But Are They Still Friendly Today?</a></span></p><h2 id=selena-gomez-returns-to-acting-in-only-murders-in-the-building><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Selena Gomez Returns To Acting In Only Murders In The Building</span></h2><p>Selena Gomez is truly a Disney Channel success story. She was able to act in Disney’s Wizards of Waverly Place without much drama other than her confusing fallout with Demi Lovato. Since then, Gomez has made a name for herself in the music industry with albums such as Revival and Rare. Her singles ‘Same Old Love,’ ‘Lose You to Love Me,’ and many more have done incredibly well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Recently, Gomez has returned to acting. She stars alongside Martin Short and Steve Martin in Hulu’s Only Murders in the Building. The show has received critical acclaim and has been well-received by viewers.</p><h2 id=hilary-duff-hated-her-time-on-disney><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Hilary Duff Hated Her Time On Disney</span></h2><p>Hilary Duff was an OG Disney Channel star. Her role of Lizzie McGuire lasted for years through her television show and films. While Duff loved the character, the fame was not as appealing. She chose to step back from the part and Disney, saying “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I don’t even know if I’m that person anymore</a>, and I don’t even have the time to figure that out. I’m done. I don’t enjoy this anymore. I’m not who I wanna be.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her exit from Disney was certainly the right decision. Duff has focused on her family and projects that bring her joy. Her recent work includes the shows Younger and How I Met Your Father. There were talks of a Lizzie McGuire reboot, but they have since been scrapped.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Hilary Duff Thinks She ‘Spooked’ Disney Into Canceling The ‘Lizzie McGuire’ Reboot</a></span></p><h2 id=demi-lovato-struggled-with-addiction><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Demi Lovato Struggled With Addiction</span></h2><p>It is not news for anyone at this point that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Demi Lovato has had a difficult relationship with addiction</a>. Lovato has struggled with drugs and alcohol since 2010, the peak of their Disney career as Sonny Munroe in Sonny with a Chance and Mitchie Torres in the film Camp Rock. They have relapsed, overdosing in 2018, and chose to share their story through songs ‘Sober’ and ‘Dancing With The Devil.’</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Getting out of Disney gave Lovato the chance to get sober, and while they have continued to struggle, they have also thrived in the music industry. Lovato’s career took off after leaving Disney.</p><h2 id=miley-cyrus-is-a-pop-star><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Miley Cyrus Is A Pop Star</span></h2><p>Miley Cyrus has gone through quite the transformation since her days playing Hannah Montana on the Disney Channel. Fans of the sweet character were blown away when Cyrus came in swinging on a wrecking ball naked—and when she danced on Robin Thicke during an award show performance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cyrus’s transformation speaks to <a href=#>the insane rules Disney sets on their stars</a>. Disney wants every star to maintain the “childhood innocence” image at all times, even when cameras are not rolling. Actors and actresses must also look the part, which might mean very strict workout and diets. Fans love watching Cyrus break free from these rules and be her authentic self.</p><h2 id=zendaya-won-an-emmy-for-euphoria><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Zendaya Won An Emmy For Euphoria</span></h2><p>After leaving the Disney show Shake It Off, Zendaya looked for more serious and daring roles. She worked alongside John David Washington in the adult drama Malcolm & Marie. She is also the lead of HBO’s Euphoria, a story of addiction and taboo. Zendaya won the Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series in 2020 for her work on the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Zendaya has also become a bit of a movie star for her contribution to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. She plays M.J. in Spider-Man. She is certainly one of the biggest success to get their start on Disney, and fans are thankful she left Disney.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqrZmiqHq4tM5mm6impGK%2FprPRnqtmpJWWw6q6xmaboquemsZw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./sarah-hyland-modern-family-relationship-brother-ian-hyland.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A Look Inside Sarah Hyland's Relationship With Her Brother">&larr;
