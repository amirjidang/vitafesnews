Whenever the fitness star appeared on the late-night show, it seemed like he was having a good time and happy to be there. But during one interview, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Richard Simmons talked about his steamer</a>, and Letterman was pretty harsh.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/richard-simmons-health-and-fitness.jpg><p>The exercise star brought out the <strong>Richard Simmons Steam Heat steamer </strong>and when the late-night host looked perplexed by it, Simmons joked, "It's not a Go-Go cart, it's a steamer." As the audience laughed, he said that he put salmon and broccoli in there, and Letterman interrupted "You know what this reminds me of is the bamboo steamer. You can get it for like eight bucks..."</p><p>When Simmons said that "everything tastes alike" in that type of steamer, Letterman said that it was "delicious." Simmons was understandably upset that he was being interrupted.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/david-letterman-criticized-richard-simmons-money.jpg><p>Simmons said:</p><p>"Why am I doing this? It costs like 55 dollars and it's in all the stores... Well, it's less than that tie, David. That's a hundred and twenty-five dollar tie. I know that tie. You spent more money on your tie than my steamer."</p><p>When Simmons demonstrated how the steamer worked, it caught on fire. He screamed and ran away, and the audience kept laughing.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fans-went-wild-when-david-letterman-publicly-slammed-jay.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Fans Went Wild When David Letterman Publicly Slammed Jay Leno During His Late Night Wars With Conan O'Brien</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>David Letterman delighted in calling Jay Leno out amid his feud with Conan O'Brien over The Tonight Show.</span><p>Although David Letterman didn't seem to think that this steamer was a good idea, the product is just one example of how successful Richard Simmons is. He <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">promoted the steamer through an infomercial</a>, and while fans can't buy it any longer, they can at least watch the ad on YouTube. In the infomercial, Simmons made spicy chicken burritos and was his usual fun-loving and warm self.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/david-letterman-s-life-completely-changed-following-his-retirement-from-the-late-night-show-front-deposit-left-deposit-right-letterman-_youtube.jpg><p><strong>Richard Simmons had many great <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">David Letterman interviews</a> </strong>during his public career. According to The New York Daily News, Simmons once came on the late-night show when "Sweetie Pie," his 1997 cookbook, came out. Letterman joked around and even tossed eggs into the air. Another time, in 1995, Letterman gave Simmons a doll that looked like Barbara Streisand because he knew that Simmons was a massive fan. Another interview that was tough to forget was when Simmons wore a turkey suit and Letterman used a fire extinguisher on him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/david-letterman-shocked-viewers-by-complimenting-one-of-mary-louise-parker-s-body-parts-on-tv-front-deposit-back-letterman.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>David Letterman Shocked Viewers By Complimenting One Of Mary-Louise Parker’s Body Parts On TV</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>What happened when Weeds star Mary-Louise Parker appeared on The Late Show With David Letterman?</span><p>As The New York Post noted, Richard Simmons talked about David Letterman in an interview with Men's Health.

He has made money from selling his Sweatin' to the Oldies fitness videos and also hosting various TV shows. Celebrity Net Worth noted that before he became famous, he was a fitness teacher in various malls in the United States. While he likely didn't make much money when he was starting out, he definitely began making more as time went on and he had more experience and exposure.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2017, E!

Before Simmons stopped appearing in public back in 2014, he taught three workout classes there. According to E! News, he charged $12 for each class. Considering how popular he was, that income would add up over time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, his main source of income seems to have always been his fitness videos. As the New York Post wrote:</p><p>"His 1988 VHS 'Sweatin’ To The Oldies' became the biggest selling fitness home video of all time, grossing north of $200 million."</p><p>In his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2012 interview with Men's Health</a>, Simmons shared that he isn't a fan of agreeing to promote a product just because it's related to the fitness industry. While he has earned millions throughout his career, he has kept his genuine love for helping people, and he sticks to his values and principles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/richard-simmons-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Simmons said:</p><p>"I’ve been offered big money to promote machines.

Anything that had to do with quick weight loss."</p><p>Simmons continued to Men's Health, "I just don’t believe in that stuff. There is no magic milkshake or workout machine.
