The famous Canadian singer has made a massive $100 million, and he spends it most lavishly. The Weekend was born Abel Makkonen Tesfaye in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, in the year 1990. His parents separated when he was very young. His mother and grandmother then raised him. Tesfaye is of Ethiopian origin and was brought up in a very spiritual and religious environment. This, however, could not stop him from falling under the influence of drugs. <a href=#>The Weeknd had a difficult childhood</a> and even admitted to being part of criminal activities to procure drugs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His education was adversely affected by his drug addiction, and he dropped out of school. He never finished his graduation. The beginning of an early career was one of the first good things that happened to him in a long while. His career began three years after he dropped out of high school. He was noticed by a producer named Jeremy Rose, who had the vision to create dark R & R&B. He wanted somebody like Abel to spearhead the movement and be the band's rapper. Eventually, he got noticed by famous personalities like Drake, landing several collaborations, and the rest is history.</p><p>Today The Weekend is not only a hip-hop legend but also a record producer. He has amassed great wealth, and he spends it justifiably. Here’s how.</p><h2 id=earns-a-prosperous-music-career>Earns: A Prosperous Music Career</h2><p>Even before he was a star, he had gotten launched into a music career with the support of Jeremy Rose. His first mixtape release was called House Of Balloons, one of the successful records that earned Drake’s attention and praise. His performances were so impressive that Drake began attending his gigs and later approached him on a collaboration. They began touring together, and The Weeknd began doing <a href=#>openings for Drake</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This was just the beginning; while opening for Drake, The Weeknd simultaneously worked on his own career. After releasing a few more mixed tapes, he was approached by various famous record labels. Among them, The Weeknd chose Republic Records, and his first three mixtapes were released under the title of Trilogy; Jeremy Rose also got his credit out of it. This album became a major success, topping on number 4 in the US Billboards.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Many Directions Zayn Malik Spends & Earns His Millions</a></span></p><p>Next, he released Kiss Land, which was part of collaborating with Drake; he also collaborated with Justin Timberlake and <a href=#>Ariana Grande, earning some fancy bucks</a> with his songs and the music tours that followed. His other high-earning albums include Beauty Behind the Madness in 2015, which sold over 1.5 million copies. Starboy in 2016, and another collaboration called My Dear Melancholy was released in 2018.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Canadian star is estimated to have made over $90 million between 2017 and 2018; by 2019, he made another mind-blowing $40 million. The Weeknd's upcoming tour in 2022 is a major hype amongst fans. It is called the After Hours tour, and it is estimated to make him about $1.2 million to $1.4 million per show.</p><h2 id=spends-real-estate>Spends: Real Estate</h2><p>The 'Starboy' is known to spend generously on luxury estates to buy himself a lavish lifestyle. He owns one of the luxury estates in Hidden Hills, which is worth an astounding $18 million. The singer tried to sell the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$18 million</a> mansion for a staggering $25 million in 2020.</p><p>He bought another property in December 2019 - a penthouse in Beverly Hills Country Club in Los Angeles, which cost him a handsome $21 million. Before moving to Los Angeles, he stayed in a rented penthouse in New York, which cost him an extravagant $60,000 per month.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=earns-other-business-endeavors>Earns: Other Business Endeavors</h2><p>Other than getting launched into a dazzling career in the music industry as <a href=#>a hip-hop artist</a>, Tesfaye has also earned fame and wealth from record-producing. He is the co-founder of the record label XO, which is under Universal Music Group's Republic Records.</p><p>He has also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">made millions</a> from working in collaboration with companies that manufacture condoms and e-cigarettes. Other than that, he has worked with Marvel and has been the face of Apple Music. He has endorsed reputed brands like Puma, A Bathing Ape, and designers like Alexander Wang. Besides, he is also a stakeholder in an esports company called OverActive Media Group.</p><h2 id=spends-philanthropy-and-2021-super-bowl-performance>Spends: Philanthropy And 2021 Super Bowl Performance</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The celebrity pop star is also a philanthropist. He has come up with his own initiative, which he calls the Black House initiative. It is meant for supporting BIPOC entrepreneurs and funding their businesses. He has also contributed to movements like BLM and other organizations like the Equal Justice Initiative, MusiCares, and the University of Toronto's Ethiopic Studies program.</p><p><a href=#>The Weeknd’s</a> grand performance at the Super Bowl Halftime Show in 2021 certainly put another big hole in the pop star's pocket. He spent a jaw-dropping <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$7 million</a> from his pocket for this event.</p><p>The Weeknd has dated famous personalities like Selena Gomez, and he was also rumored to have gotten back with the supermodel Bella Hadid before separating again in 2019. He has also been part of certain controversies, like serving 50 hours of community service after misbehaving with a cop in Las Vegas, but he has come a long way and has reached heights of success. He is the recipient of prestigious awards like the Grammy, Billboard Awards, and American Music Awards.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Drake: 6 Ways The Rapper Earns And Spends His Fortune</a></span></p><p>Source:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Business World</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Cosmopolitan</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marie Daire</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTEprHKp5tmnZ2ltrOxjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./frescos-naturales-on-shark-tank-cost-founder-backstory-and-more-about-sparkling-drink-business-550688-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Frescos Naturales on Shark Tank: Cost, founder, backstory, and more about sparkling drink business">&larr;
