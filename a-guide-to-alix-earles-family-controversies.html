Paparazzi had shown up at my house and my mom quickly got me and my sister out of the house [and] over to my cousins … I didn’t know they were paparazzi.”</p><p>After she learned <a href=#>about the affair</a>, she “felt like my world crashed down in that moment.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to learn more about Alix’s half-siblings, her stepmom and her parents.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Alix-Earles-Blended-Family-of-8-5.jpg><h3>Alisa Earle, Alix’s Mother</h3><p><strong>Alisa</strong> was previously married to TJ. In December 2000, they welcomed Alix and the family grew with daughter Ashtin in April 2003. In 2008, news broke that TJ was cheating on Alisa and the pair <a href=#>divorced sometime</a> while Alix was in 3rd grade.</p><p>Alisa has been seen in multiple of Alix’s TikToks, including dancing videos, <a href=# rel=noopener>mother-daughter sleepovers</a>, vacations and nights out.</p><p>In the “Call Her Daddy” episode, Alisa gushed over her eldest daughter, “I believe Alix got her craziness, kindness and her energy for having fun form me … and all the other good stuff from her dad.”</p><h3>TJ Earle, Alix’s Father</h3><p>TJ is the Vice President of two New Jersey companies in the construction and soil recycling industries.</p><p>After his divorce from Alisa, he<a href=#> married Ashey</a> in 2013. Since then, the couple have welcomed three children together: Izabel, Penelope and Thomas.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Alix-Earles-Blended-Family-of-8-4.png><h3>Ashley Earle Alix’s Stepmom</h3><p>After <a href=#>marrying</a> TJ, Ashley put her call-girl life in her past to raise Izabel, Penelope and Thomas.</p><p>Alix reflected on how Ashley’s affair with her dad affected her during the “Call Her Daddy” episode. “When my stepmom started to hang around with my dad after he had moved out, we were introduced to her — which was super weird. I was told that I had to be respectful to this woman and we had to be nice to her and I wanted to rip her head off.,” Alix said. “It was very weird because I felt like I was a 10-year-old having to be more mature than someone [who was] 20, 30 years older than me.”</p><p>She’s in a <a href=#>better place with her stepmom</a> now. “[We’re] super close, and we’ve gotten to such a good point. Whatever’s happened in the past, we’ve all gotten past it as a family,” Alix told<a href=#> Elle </a>in August 2023.</p><p>She added, “One time, I was overwhelmed about something of mine and I called my dad. He was like, ‘You should really talk to Ashley about this. She has dealt with this before, stuff in the media.’ It’s brought us closer because she’s able to guide me through it.”</p><p>Ashley first gained notability in 2008 during <a href=#><strong>Eliot Spitzer</strong></a>’s prostitution scandal, which led to him resign as the governor of New York.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Alix-Earles-Blended-Family-of-8-6.jpg><h3>Ashtin Earle, Alix’s Sister</h3><p><strong>Ashtin</strong> is the daughter of Alisa and TJ.

She has appeared in a <a href=# rel=noopener>number of Alix’s TikToks</a>. She helps her sister pick out outfits, watches her do her makeup and shows her personality through sassy remarks.</p><p>“You guys might see the ‘Get Ready With Me’s,’ but I see behind the scenes,” she said in the “Call Her Daddy” episode while flipping her hair. “And it’s a hot mess!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Alix-Earles-Blended-Family-of-8-2.png><h3>Penelope Earle, Alix’s Half-Sister</h3><p>Penelope is the middle child of TJ and Ashley.
