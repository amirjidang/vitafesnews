While only a few actors got the opportunity to be a <a href=#>part of the main cast</a>, many others were also fortunate to appear in guest roles over the years.Sex and the City star Kristin Davis featured in only one episode of the show, but was very impressed by how the main cast carried themselves. She even <a href=#>reserved special praise for Lisa Kudrow</a>, who played Phoebe Buffay in the series. Being a guest star on Friends did not always guarantee a great experience, however.Some like Davis are lucky enough to be able to remember their short stints fondly. The same can be said for Christian Applegate, who was actually <a href=#>shocked by the Primetime Emmy Award she won</a> following her guest appearances in two episodes of the series in 2002 and 2003.<span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Cast Of Friends Did Some Weird Roles Before Getting Famous</a></span>On the other hand, <a href=#>Lauren Tom was taken aback when she was booed by the live audience</a>, who clearly did not like her character’s romantic involvement with David Schwimmer’s Ross Geller. Young Guns star Dermot Mulroney was another who got his chance to guest star on Friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-character-did-dermot-mulroney-play-in-friends>What Character Did Dermot Mulroney Play In Friends?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/dermot-mulroney-2005.jpg><p>Dermot Mulroney is best known for his roles in films such as My Best Friend's Wedding and August: Osage County. In Friends, he played the role of Gavin Mitchell, a former rodeo clown who works for the Ralph Lauren Corporation, and is introduced as a love interest for <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Aniston</strong></a>’s Rachel Green.</p><p>Gavin was first seen in Season 9 episode <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The One Where Rachel Goes Back to Work</a>. His character spanned the course of only three episodes, the highlight of which was a passionate kiss he shared with Rachel, which really only served to escalate the tension between her and Ross. He was not even mentioned ever again following his short character arc in the series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Friends Guest-Star Needed To Re-Shoot All His Scenes Due To How Loud The Live Audience Would Get</a></span></p><p>But despite being a minor character in the overall story of Friends, Mulroney's role as Gavin was a memorable and enjoyable performance, that helped to add a little flavor to the show in its penultimate season.</p><p>His character’s fleeting romance with Rachel added an interesting new dynamic, and helped to build the conflict in her own romantic arc.</p><h2 id=dermot-mulroney-later-played-a-recurring-role-in-shameless>Dermot Mulroney Later Played A Recurring Role In Shameless</h2><p>About a dozen years after his final cameo in Friends, Dermot Mulroney <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">joined the cast of Showtime’s comedy drama series Shameless</a> in 2015.</p><p>He played the recurring role of Sean Pierce, the boss of main character Fiona Gallagher – portrayed by Emmy Rossum.

I’ve loved him for so many years, so it’s really fun to have him playing with us,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she told Collider in an interview</a> in February 2015.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>These Two Iconic 'Friends' Guest-Stars Went Completely Off-Script For Their Entire Scene</a></span></p><p>“He really fits in, really well,” Rossum continued. “It’s an interesting character to watch what he’ll go through this season.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-other-roles-has-dermot-mulroney-played-since-his-time-on-friends>What Other Roles Has Dermot Mulroney Played Since His Time On Friends?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/tharita-cesaroni-dermot-mulroney.jpg><p>Since he made his final appearance in Friends, Dermot Mulroney has continued to work consistently in film and television, establishing himself as a versatile and talented actor.
