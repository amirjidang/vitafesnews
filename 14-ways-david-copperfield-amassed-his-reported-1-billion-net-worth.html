The star has been in business since the 80s and does not appear to be going anywhere anytime soon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only does he have one of the biggest shows at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, but he also continues to tour worldwide, making him the best selling act in history, beating out names such as Michael Jackson, Madonna and Elvis Presley. Considering he holds the Guinness World Record for most tickets sold by a solo act, it goes without saying that Copperfield is rich.</p><p>Across&nbsp;his sold-out shows, magic memorabilia, television specials and stints on tv and film, it makes sense as to why David Copperfield has become the first-ever billionaire in the world of magic and illusion. With over five decades of work, here are the ways David Copperfield has made his remarkable $1 billion net worth.</p><h2 id=las-vegas-shows><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Las Vegas Shows</span></h2><p>David Copperfield has managed to make a reported $1 billion from many things, however, his most successful one remains his Las Vegas residency. Copperfield has had a residency for nearly 15 years at the MGM Grand, and has managed to sell a whopping 40 million tickets, making more than $4 billion in revenue, says <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=world-tours><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>World Tours</span></h2><p>In addition to his successful Las Vegas shows, David Copperfield has also been on over five world tours throughout his career, selling out each and every single one of them. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Playbill</a>, the star's 1996 'Dreams & Nightmares' show holds the record for most tickets sold in a week!</p><h2 id=magic-show-merchandise><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Magic Show Merchandise</span></h2><p>While David Copperfield is racking up hundreds of millions of dollars on his residency and world tours, he is also making bank on his merchandise! The magician is the sole earner when it comes to t-shirts, posters and practically anything sold at his shows, which if you've ever been to a show of any kind, you know merch doesn't come cheap.</p><h2 id=bahamian-private-islands><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Bahamian Private Islands</span></h2><p>David Copperfield purchased a number of private islands back in 2006 in the Bahamas, as one does. The illusionist bought them for a whopping $50 million, however, he is now making money on them. The star rents out these islands to wealthy celebs and worldwide elite for over $40,000 per night!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">You Can Buy This Mansion With Its Own Race Track For $17.5 Billion</a></span></p><h2 id=magic-memorabilia><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Magic Memorabilia</span></h2><p>In addition to his very own merchandise, David Copperfield also own a lot of magic memorabilia. The star is not only in possession of many of his own historic costumes and props but owns memorabilia that once belonged to some of the greatest illusionists before Copperfield, such as Houdini, Hanks Klok and Franz Harary, which has been said to be worth well over $200 million.</p><h2 id=meet-amp-greets><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Meet & Greets</span></h2><p>If you thought that David Copperfield was making money off of tickets and tickets alone, you would be sorely mistaken. The magician also charges and arm and a leg for his meet and greets, and when you take into consideration 15 shows a week, and a thousand dollar price tag on a photo with him, then you know he's rolling in dough!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=magic-museum><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Magic Museum</span></h2><p>Considering David Copperfield is the owner of so much magic memorabilia once owned and used by some of the greatest magicians and illusionists in the world, it would only make sense for him to have his very own magic museum. After purchasing an old library for $2 million, Copperfield transformed it into what is now known as the International Museum and Library of the Conjuring Arts.</p><h2 id=government-work><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Government Work</span></h2><p style=text-align:left>While this one may seem slightly out of place, it is still well worth mentioning. Back in October 2012, residents of the US state of Maryland received a robocall from David Copperfield himself supporting a ballot initiative that would expand gambling in the state. This certainly seems quite off-brand for Copperfield, but we bet he managed to score a nice paycheck for the recording.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Movies To Make You Feel Like Everything Is Going To Be OK</a></span></p><h2 id=u-s-real-estate><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>U.S Real Estate</span></h2><p>In addition to David Copperfield's private islands, he also owns a series of real estate in New York City and Las Vegas. The magician owns a penthouse just north of Central Park and a Vegas mansion only minutes from the Vegas Strip, all of which he rents out for thousands of dollars per night, too!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=talk-show-appearances><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Talk Show Appearances</span></h2><p>Considering David Copperfield is one of the best illusionists in the world, it is only fitting that he would be very sought after. The star has appeared on many talk shows throughout his career, and while this is usually done so to promote a show or product in exchange for screen-time, Copperfield would usually be paid for his appearances, particularly those he would be performing on.</p><h2 id=disney-underground-restaurant><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Disney&nbsp;Underground Restaurant</span></h2><p>David Copperfield had signed on agreement with Disney-MGM Studios to open a series of underground magic-related restaurants at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Disneyland in California, Paris and Tokyo and even in Times Square. The star was cut a big check, however, none of the projects came to fruition, and&nbsp;it remains a mystery as to why says &nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Theme Park University</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=television-specials><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Television Specials</span></h2><p>While David Copperfield has found his way into a number of talk shows, he has also been the star of many television specials. Whether he was teaching viewers a few tricks, touring his private island, or having a production company film his show, you bet he was always racking in a big paycheck!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Magician Bamboozles Dog At Shelter</a></span></p><h2 id=movie-cameos><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Movie Cameos</span></h2><p>David Copperfield is not only a magic show master, but he has also appeared in a number of television shows and films! Not only has he voiced a series of animated movies, but he's also appeared in films and shows as himself or as characters, including his work on "Terror Train", "Scrubs", "The Simpsons" and Disney's "Wizards Of Waverly Place".</p><h2 id=project-magic><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Project Magic</span></h2><p>David Copperfield may be worth a lot of money, but he definitely knows what to do with it! While this one does not actively make Copperfield himself money, it makes his charity a lot of money, which in turn, helps a lot of people. David created Project Magic back in 1982, which is a rehabilitation program to help disables patients regain lost or damaged dexterity skills.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Bartender's Magic Trick Blew These Redditors' Minds</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhobWWnlsa0ecOaraKcXZi8sbzEq52inZyZeqK5wKyqnpxdnba0edGep6iqpJqxbn2Mm6ClpJmku266xK1ksKeiqbVw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./15-surprising-facts-about-the-beautiful-emma-roberts.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Surprising Facts About The Beautiful Emma Roberts">&larr;
